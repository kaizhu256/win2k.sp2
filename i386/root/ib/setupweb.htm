          <p>Before installing your server, make sure that you have chosen hardware that supports Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">System Requirements</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>To ensure adequate performance, make sure that computers on which you install Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, meet the following requirements:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  One or two processors with a recommended minimum speed of 550 MHz (minimum supported speed is 133 MHz). A maximum of two processors per computer is supported. Processors from the Intel Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or compatible processors are recommended. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  256 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended minimum (128 MB minimum supported; 2&#160;gigabytes (GB) maximum). <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  A hard disk partition or volume with enough free space to accommodate the setup process. To ensure that you have flexibility in your later use of the operating system, it is recommended that you allow considerably more space than the minimum required for running Setup, which is approximately 1.25&#160;GB to 2&#160;GB. The larger amount of space is required if you are running Setup across a network instead of from a CD-ROM. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  You must use NTFS as the file system with Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition.<br></br>
                </li></ul>
              <table class="alertTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="txtCell">Note </td></tr><tr><td class="alertCell">
                <p>The setup process requires the free disk space described in the previous paragraph. After Setup is finished, actual hard disk space used for the operating system will be more than the free space required for Setup, because of space needed for the paging file and for any optional components you install. The usual size for the paging file is 1.5 times the size of the RAM. For information about the paging file and about optional components, see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>

                  VGA or higher-resolution monitor (Super VGA 800x600 or higher recommended), keyboard, and (optionally) a mouse or other pointing device. <br></br>
                  As an alternative, for operation without a monitor or keyboard, you can choose a remote&#160;diagnostic and support processor that is designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family.

                  Appropriate hardware for the functionality you require. For example, if you require sound, you must have a compatible sound card with speakers or headphones, and if you plan to support network clients, the servers and clients must have appropriate network adapters and cables.

          <h4 class="subHeading">Hardware Compatibility</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>One of the most important steps to take before installing a server is to confirm that your hardware is compatible with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. You can do this by running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD or by checking the hardware compatibility information at the Windows Catalog Web site. Also, as part of confirming hardware compatibility, check to see that you have obtained updated hardware device drivers and an updated system BIOS.</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether you run a preinstallation compatibility check, Setup checks hardware and software compatibility at the beginning of an installation and displays a report if there are incompatibilities.</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD</h5>
                  <p>You can run a hardware and software compatibility check from the Setup CD. The compatibility check does not require you to actually begin an installation. To run the check, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and, when a display appears, follow the prompts for checking system compatibility. You will be offered the option to download the latest Setup files (through Dynamic Update) when you run the check. If you have Internet connectivity, it is recommended that you allow the download.</p>
                  <p>For more information about downloading the latest Setup files, see "Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files" later in this topic.</p>
                  <p>Another way to run the compatibility check is to insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive, open a command prompt, and type:</p>
                  <p>
                    <i>d</i>:<b>\i386\winnt32 /checkupgradeonly</b></p>
                  <p>where <i>d</i> represents the CD-ROM drive.</p>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Checking hardware and software compatibility information on the Microsoft Web site</h5>
                  <p>Another way to confirm that your hardware and software are designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family is to check the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Checking drivers and system BIOS</h5>
                  <p>Check that you have obtained updated drivers for your hardware devices and that you have the latest system BIOS. The device manufacturers can help you obtain these items.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family by checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>
              <p>If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.</p>
              <p>If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files on the Setup CD, and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file, restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6: at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts to include your HAL file in the Setup process.</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If you have a working Internet connection on the computer on which you run Setup, you can choose Dynamic Update during Setup and obtain the most up-to-date Setup files, including drivers and other files. Whenever an important update is made to any crucial Setup file, that update is made available through Dynamic Update functionality built into the Windows Update Web site. Some of the updated files will be replacements (for example, an updated driver or updated Setup file) and some will be additions (for example, a driver not available at the time that the Setup CD was created). It is recommended that you use Dynamic Update when running Setup.</p>
              <p>Dynamic Update has been carefully designed so that it is reliable and easy to use:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  The files on the Dynamic Update section of the Windows Update Web site have been carefully tested and selected. Only files that are important in ensuring that Setup runs well are made available through Dynamic Update. Files with minor updates that will not significantly affect Setup are not part of Dynamic Update. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Because Dynamic Update downloads only the files that are required for your computer, the Dynamic Update software briefly examines your computer hardware. No personal information is collected, and no information is saved. The only purpose is to select appropriate drivers for your hardware configuration. This keeps the download as short as possible and ensures that only necessary drivers are downloaded to your hard disk. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  You can use Dynamic Update when running a preinstallation compatibility check from the product CD, or when running Setup itself. Either way, you obtain the most up-to-date files for running Setup. For information about running the compatibility check, see "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  You can use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup. Preparing for this requires several steps. For a brief description of unattended Setup, see the "Planning for Unattended Setup" section in "<a href="#BKMK_2">Running Setup for a New Installation</a>" later in this topic. For details about how to use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup (also called automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing Installations" in the <i>Windows Server&#160;2003 Deployment Kit</i>. <br></br>

                  <p>If you are performing a new installation, review your disk partitions or volumes before you run Setup. Both partitions and volumes divide a disk into one or more areas that can be formatted for use by one file system. Different partitions and volumes often have different drive letters (for example, C: and D:). After you run Setup, you can make adjustments to the disk configuration, as long as you do not reformat or change the partition or volume that contains the operating system. For information about planning the partitions or volumes for a new installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New Installations" later in this topic.</p>

          <p>Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions on a basic disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS (with Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, use only NTFS). Different partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C: and D:). A basic disk can have up to four primary partitions, or three primary partitions and one extended partition. (An extended partition can be subdivided into logical drives, while a primary partition cannot be subdivided.)</p>
          <table class="alertTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="txtCell">Important </td></tr><tr><td class="alertCell">
            <p>If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand, because these actions will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk contents, it is recommended that you back up the entire contents of the hard disk before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more of your partitions alone.</p>
          </td></tr></table>
          <table class="alertTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="txtCell">Note </td></tr><tr><td class="alertCell">
            <p>If you plan to install to a dynamic disk (a disk type that can be created only with Windows&#160;2000, Windows&#160;XP, or a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family), you cannot change the volume or partition sizes on the disk during Setup, and therefore no planning is needed regarding partition sizes. Instead, review the guidelines in "Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this topic.</p>
          </td></tr></table>
          <p>Before you run Setup to perform a new installation, determine the size of the partition on which to install. There is no set formula for figuring a partition size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating system, applications, and other files that you plan to put on the installation partition. The files for setting up Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, require approximately 1.25&#160;GB to 2&#160;GB, as described in "System Requirements" earlier in this topic. It is recommended that you allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. It is not unreasonable to allow 4&#160;GB to 10&#160;GB on the partition, or more for large installations. This allows space for a variety of items, including optional components, logs, future service packs, the paging file used by the operating system, and other items.</p>
          <p>When you perform a new installation, you can specify the partition on which to install. If you specify a partition on which another operating system exists, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.</p>
          <p>During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to install Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition. After installation is complete, you can use Disk Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming, and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks; and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic to basic.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">File System Requirements for the Installation Partition</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>On Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, you must use NTFS as the file system. NTFS includes a variety of features not included in the FAT or FAT32 file systems, including better scalability to large drives, better security, greater flexibility in compressing and uncompressing, and many other features. If you want to install Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, on a computer that has one or more FAT or FAT32 partitions, delete the FAT or FAT32 partitions during Setup. Then, if necessary, create the partition on which you will install Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, and choose NTFS as the file system for that partition. For information about deleting or creating partitions during Setup, see the next section, "Options When Partitioning a Disk."</p>
              <p>For information about the modifications you can make to the disk after Setup, see the previous section, "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New Installations."</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Options When Partitioning a Disk</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.</p>
              <p>If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the following options:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the partition on which you will install a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk space, you can create the partition for your Windows Server&#160;2003 family product by using the unpartitioned space. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough, you can install a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family on that partition, with or without reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition erases all data on the partition. If you do not reformat the partition, but you do install a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family where there is already an operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and you must reinstall any applications you want to use with the Windows Server&#160;2003 family product. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to create more unpartitioned disk space for a partition for a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that partition.<br></br>
                </li></ul>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>A dynamic disk is a disk using the new storage type introduced with Windows&#160;2000. If you changed a disk to dynamic and you want to perform a new installation on the disk, review the following.</p>
              <ul><li>
                  If you used Windows&#160;2000 or Windows&#160;XP to change a disk with no partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk to basic before you can install an operating system on&#160;it. <br></br>

                  You can use Windows&#160;2000 or Windows&#160;XP to revert the disk, or you can use the Setup program for a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. To use Windows&#160;2000 or Windows&#160;XP, follow the instructions in Help for your operating system. To use Setup for a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, during the partitioning phase, find the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and then delete it (which erases all data on all volumes). You will be prompted to confirm your action. After you do this, the disk will contain only unpartitioned space, and you can use Setup to create a new (basic disk) partition on it.<br></br>

          <p>TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or different network adapters and their associated protocols on your servers.</p>
          <p>To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this type of name to an IP address is called name resolution, and can be accomplished by various methods, primarily the Domain Name System (DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more information.</p>
          <p>For detailed information about TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, and WINS, see Help and Support Center as well as the <i>Windows Server&#160;2003 Technical Reference</i>. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">IP Addresses</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>As outlined in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an IP address be provided for each computer. This section describes IP addressing options. For descriptions of name resolution options, which are also needed in a TCP/IP network, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" later in this topic.</p>
              <p>There are two basic approaches for providing an IP address for a server you are installing:</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</h5>
                  <p>You can provide IP addresses to the computers on your network by configuring one or more DHCP servers, which provide IP addresses dynamically to other computers. A DHCP server must itself be assigned a static IP address.</p>
                  <p>One server or several servers can provide DHCP along with one or more name resolution services, which are called Domain Name System (DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The name resolution services are described in the next section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP."</p>
                  <p>If you want to run Setup before you have finalized your decisions about which server to use as your DHCP server and what static IP address to assign to that server, you can choose <b>Typical settings</b> in the <b>Networking Settings</b> dialog box during Setup and complete the network configuration later. If you do this and there is no DHCP server in the network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). During the time that a server is using APIPA, it can communicate only with other computers using APIPA on the same network segment. A server that is using APIPA cannot make connections to the Internet (for browsing or e-mail), and cannot be used with DNS or Active Directory&#174; (which depends on DNS).</p>
                  <p>If you know which server you want to use as your DHCP server, when installing that server, in the Networking Settings dialog box in Setup, choose Custom settings, and specify a static IP address and related network settings. For more information about how to do this, see “Specifying Networking Settings” in "<a href="#BKMK_2">Running Setup for a New Installation</a>" later in this topic. After Setup, use information in Help and Support Center (click <b>Start</b> and then click <b>Help and Support</b>) to learn how to complete the configuration of DHCP in your network.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Static IP addressing</h5>
                  <p>For certain types of servers, you must assign a static IP address and subnet mask during or after Setup. These servers include DHCP servers, DNS servers, WINS servers, and any server providing access to users on the Internet. It is also recommended that you assign a static IP address and subnet mask for each domain controller. If a computer has more than one network adapter, you must assign a separate IP address for each adapter.</p>
                  <p>If you want to run Setup on a server before you have finalized your decision about the static IP address you want to assign to that server, you can choose <b>Typical settings</b> in the <b>Networking Settings</b> dialog box during Setup and configure that server later. In this situation, if there is a DHCP server in the network, Setup will obtain an IP address configuration from DHCP. If there is no DHCP server in the network, Setup will use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). APIPA is described in the previous item in this list, "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)."</p>
                  <p>For more information about static IP addresses, including private IP addresses (which you choose from certain ranges of addresses) and public IP addresses (which you obtain from an Internet service provider), see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>
                  <p>After you have formed a plan for IP addressing, the next components to consider are those for name resolution, which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The following sections describe options for name resolution.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Name Resolution for TCP/IP</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. The name-resolution services are Domain Name System (DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">DNS</h5>
                  <p>DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is often used as a name resolution service in domains with clients running Windows&#160;2000, Windows&#160;XP, or products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family.</p>
                  <p>If you need to install DNS on a computer running Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, complete Setup and then use Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.</p>
                  <p>If you plan to install DNS on a server, specify a static IP address on that server and configure that server to use that IP address for its own name resolution. For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Static IP Addressing" earlier in this topic. For more information about configuring DNS, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>).</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">WINS</h5>
                  <p>If you provide support for clients running Windows&#160;NT&#174; or any earlier Microsoft operating system, you might need to install Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. You might also need to install WINS if it is required by your applications. You can install WINS after Setup by using Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.</p>
                  <p>If you plan to install WINS on a server, specify a static IP address on that server. For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Static IP Addressing" earlier in this topic. For more information about configuring WINS, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>).</p>

          <p>A <i>domain</i> is a group of accounts and network resources that share a common directory database and set of security policies, and might have security relationships with other domains. A <i>workgroup</i> is a more basic grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.</p>
          <p>In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and permissions are simpler to keep track of, because a domain has a single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other network details. The information in this database is replicated automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. (A server running Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, cannot be a domain controller.) You can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.</p>
          <p>Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more information about Active Directory, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>).</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Additional Information About Domains</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>For information about working with domain controllers in the domain in which Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, is a member server, see Help and Support Center, which is available after you install (or upgrade to) a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family on your first server. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>

      <p>This topic provides recommendations for preparing your system for a new installation, and it explains how to run Setup for Microsoft&#174; Windows&#160;Server&#8482;&#160;2003, Web Edition. Before reading this topic or running Setup, be sure to read "<a href="#BKMK_1">Getting Ready for a New Installation</a>" earlier in this topic.</p>
      <p>For technical information and resources to help you evaluate, deploy, and administer the Windows server operating systems, see the Windows Server TechCenter on the Web at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=28944" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=28944</a></p>

          <p>This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your server for a new installation.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Checking the System Log for Errors</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If the computer already has a working operating system, review the system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors) that could cause problems during the installation. For information about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on your computer.</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Backing Up Files</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Before you perform a new installation, it is recommended that you back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or the current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or the hard disk of another computer on the network.</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Disconnecting UPS Devices</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection process.</p>

      <a name="StartingSetup"></a><A name="EFJBDBHA"></A><h3 class="subHeading">Starting Setup</h3><div class="subSection">
          <p>This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation.</p>
          <p>Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying files, and restarting.</p>
          <p>For important information to help you make the initial choices offered by Setup, see "<a href="#BKMK_1">Getting Ready for a New Installation</a>" earlier in this topic. For information about unattended Setup and other options available when you start Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in this topic.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process</h5>
                  <p>If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family by checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>
                  <p>If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.</p>
                  <p>If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file, restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Using a Custom HAL File</h5>
                  <p>If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6: at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts to include your HAL file in the Setup process.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Starting Setup</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD" and "Starting a New Installation from a Network," explain how to start Setup for a new installation.</p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Starting a New Installation from a CD</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If you use the Setup CD, you have several options for starting Setup, as explained in the following procedures:</p>
              <table class="alertTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="txtCell">Note </td></tr><tr><td class="alertCell">
                <p>If you are running Setup on a computer running Windows&#160;3.x or MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk caching. Otherwise, the Setup process (started from Winnt.exe) could take a long time. To enable disk caching on a computer running Windows&#160;3.x or MS-DOS, you can use SMARTDrive.

                      <p>To begin Setup, do one of the following: </p>
                      <ul><li>
                          For a computer running any version of Windows other than Windows&#160;3.x, wait for Setup to display a dialog box. <br></br>
                        </li><li>
                          For a computer running Windows&#160;3.x, use File Manager to change to the CD-ROM drive and to change to the I386 directory, and then double-click Winnt.exe.<br></br>

          <p>This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called automated installation), see the Microsoft Windows Resource Kits Web site at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=29883" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=29883</a></p>
          <p>To simplify the process of setting up a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family on multiple computers, you can run Setup unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer file, a customized script that answers the Setup questions automatically. Then, you run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options for unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating system that is running when you start unattended Setup:</p>
          <ul><li>
              To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or Windows&#160;3.x, use Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options). <br></br>
            </li><li>
              To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows&#160;95, Windows&#160;98, Windows&#160;Millennium Edition, Windows&#160;NT, Windows&#160;2000, Windows&#160;XP, or a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, use Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options). With Windows&#160;NT 4.0, before starting unattended Setup, apply Service Pack&#160;5 or later.<br></br>

                  <p>During Setup, in the <b>Computer Name and Administrator Password</b> dialog box, follow the instructions for entering your computer name. The recommended length for most languages is 15 characters or less. For languages that require more storage space per character, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended length is 7 characters or less.</p>
                  <p>It is recommended that you use only Internet-standard characters in the computer name. The standard characters are the numbers from 0 through 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A through Z, and the hyphen (-) character. Computer names cannot consist entirely of numbers.</p>
                  <p>If you are using DNS on your network, you can use a wider variety of characters, including Unicode characters and other nonstandard characters, such as the ampersand (&amp;). Using nonstandard characters might affect the ability of non-Microsoft software to operate on your network. For more information about DNS, see the "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" section in "<a href="#BKMK_1">Getting Ready for a New Installation</a>" earlier in this topic.</p>
                  <p>The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in some), computers running Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0 and earlier will recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. In addition, there are additional configuration steps for a name that is longer than 15 bytes. For more information, in Help and Support Center, see "Namespace planning for DNS." To view Help and Support Center, after running Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>
                  <p>If a computer is part of a domain, you must choose a computer name that is different from any other computer in the domain. To avoid name conflicts, the computer should be unique on the domain, workgroup, or network. If this computer is part of a domain, and it contains more than one operating system, you must use a unique computer name for each operating system that is installed. For example, if the computer name is FileServerNT when the computer is started with Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0, the computer must have a different name, perhaps FileServerNew, when it is started with a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. This requirement also applies to a computer that contains multiple installations of the same operating system.

      <a name="ProductActivationforProductsintheWindowsServer2003Family"></a><A name="EFBBDBHA"></A><h3 class="subHeading">Product Activation for Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 Family</h3><div class="subSection">
          <p>After you install a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This results in better products and more innovation for customers.</p>
          <p>The following details help explain product activation:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Software reminders</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function, except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop for Administration (the new name for the Windows&#160;2000 functionality known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>How the software handles activation</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product, it means that your product key is now associated with the computer (the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)).</p>
          <p>Your local operating system does some of the work of creating the association between your product key and the computer it is installed on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key, and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer (without representing any personal information or anything about the software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person’s activation will not work.</p>
          <p>The Installation ID that the local operating system generates, representing the association between your product key and the computer it is install on, is used only for the purpose of activation.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Methods for activation</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;After your operating system is installed, begin activation by clicking <b>Start</b>, and then clicking <b>Activate Windows</b>. (You can also click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the screen.) By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate through the Internet or by phone:</p>
          <ul><li>
              
                <b>Internet:</b> When you activate through the Internet, your computer transmits coded information that shows that your product key is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is passed back to your computer, automatically activating your product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to complete. No personally identifiable information is required to activate your product. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              
                <b>Phone:</b> When you activate by phone, information on the screen guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the country or region where you are located, a phone number (toll-free, wherever possible) appears on your screen. When you call the number, a customer service representative asks for the Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The customer service representative enters that number into a secure database, confirms that the number represents a legally installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then, you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the screen, and activation is complete.<br></br>
            </li></ul>
          <p>
            <b>Reactivation (rarely needed)</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick, simple process, you can reactivate your product.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Product Activation Compared to Product Registration</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Product activation is not the same as product registration. As discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional, and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive information about product updates and special offers directly from Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely, and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.</p>

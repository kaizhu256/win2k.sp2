          <p>This section compares upgrading to performing a new installation, to help you confirm your decision to upgrade. Upgrading is either replacing Windows&#160;NT&#174;&#160;4.0 (with Service Pack&#160;5 or later) with a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, or replacing Windows&#160;2000 with a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. Installing, in contrast with upgrading, means completely removing the previous operating system, or installing a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family on a disk or disk partition with no previous operating system.</p>
          <p>The following lists describe items to consider when deciding between an upgrade and a new installation:</p>
        
          <div class="subSection">
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Points to consider for an upgrade:</h5>
                  <ul><li>
                      With an upgrade, configuration is simpler, and your existing users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are retained. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      With an upgrade, you do not need to re-install files and applications. As with any major changes to the hard disk, however, it is recommended that you back up the disk before beginning an upgrade. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Before planning to perform an upgrade, see "Operating Systems from Which You Can Upgrade" later in this topic. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If you are upgrading in a domain that includes domain controllers running Windows&#160;2000, be sure to read "Upgrades in a Domain Containing Windows&#160;2000 Domain Controllers" later in this topic. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If you are upgrading in a domain where all domain controllers run Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, be sure to read "Upgrades in a Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 Domain" later in this topic. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If you want to upgrade and then use the same applications as before, be sure to review applications information in Relnotes.htm (on the Setup CD). Also, for the most recent information about compatible applications for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, see the software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37604" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37604</a><br></br>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Points to consider for a new installation:</h5>
                  <ul><li>
                      If you reformat your hard disk and then perform a new installation, the efficiency of your disk might improve (compared to not reformatting it). Reformatting also gives you the opportunity to modify the size or number of disk partitions, to make them match your requirements more closely. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If you want to practice careful configuration management, for example, for a server where high availability is important, you might want to perform a new installation on that server instead of an upgrade. This is especially true on servers on which the operating system has been upgraded several times in the past. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      It is possible to install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, and also allow the computer to sometimes run another operating system. Setting up the computer this way, however, presents complexities because of file system issues.

          <h4 class="subHeading">System Requirements</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>To ensure adequate performance, make sure that computers on which you upgrade to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, meet the following requirements:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  
                    <b>For an x86-based computer:</b>
                  <br></br>
                  <ul><li>
                      One or more processors with a recommended minimum speed of 550 MHz (minimum supported speed is 133 MHz). A maximum of eight processors per computer is supported. Processors from the Intel Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or compatible processors are recommended. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      256 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended minimum (128 MB minimum supported, 32&#160;gigabytes (GB) maximum). <br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                  For computers with more than 4 GB of RAM, be sure to check the hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37824" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37824</a><br></br>
                  A hard disk partition or volume with enough free space to accommodate the setup process. To ensure that you have flexibility in your later use of the operating system, it is recommended that you allow considerably more space than the minimum required for running Setup, which is approximately 2&#160;GB to 3&#160;GB for x86-based versions of Windows Server&#160;2003, and 4 GB for Itanium-based and x64-based versions of Windows Server&#160;2003. The larger amount of space is required if you are running Setup across a network instead of from a CD-ROM.<br></br>
                  In addition, a domain controller upgrade from Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 could require much more space than other upgrades, because the existing user accounts database can expand by as much as a factor of ten during the upgrade, as Active Directory&#174; functionality is added.<br></br>

                    <p>The setup process requires the free disk space described in the previous paragraphs. After Setup is finished, actual hard disk space used for the operating system will be more than the free space required for Setup, because of space needed for the paging file, for any optional components you install, and (on domain controllers) for user accounts and other Active Directory information. The usual size for the paging file is 1.5 times the size of the RAM. For information about the paging file, optional components, user accounts, and information stored in Active Directory, see Help and Support Center.

                  Appropriate hardware for the functionality you require. For example, if you plan to support network clients, the servers and clients must have appropriate network adapters and cables. As another example, if you require a server cluster, the entire cluster solution must be listed as compatible with Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition.

          <h4 class="subHeading">Hardware Compatibility</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>One of the most important steps to take before upgrading your server is to confirm that your hardware is compatible with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. You can do this by running a preupgrade compatibility check from the Setup CD or by checking the hardware compatibility information at the Windows Catalog Web site. Also, as part of confirming hardware compatibility, check to see that you have obtained updated hardware device drivers and an updated system BIOS (or for an Itanium-based computer, the correct firmware).</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether you run a preupgrade compatibility check, Setup checks hardware and software compatibility at the beginning of an upgrade and displays a report if there are incompatibilities.</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Running a preupgrade compatibility check from the Setup CD</h5>
                  <p>You can run a hardware and software compatibility check from the Setup CD. The compatibility check does not require you to actually begin an upgrade. To run the check, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and, when a display appears, follow the prompts for checking system compatibility. You will be offered the option to download the latest Setup files (through Dynamic Update) when you run the check. If you have Internet connectivity, it is recommended that you allow the download.</p>
                  <p>For more information about downloading the latest Setup files, see "Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files" later in this topic.</p>
                  <p>Another way to run the compatibility check is to insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive, open a command prompt, and type:</p>
                  <p>
                    <i>d</i>:<b>\i386\winnt32 /checkupgradeonly</b></p>
                  <p>where <i>d</i> represents the CD-ROM drive.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Checking hardware and software compatibility information on the Microsoft Web site</h5>
                  <p>Another way to confirm that your hardware and software are designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family is to check the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>
                  <p>Note that one type of hardware no longer supported is the microchannel bus.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Checking drivers and system BIOS or firmware</h5>
                  <p>Check that you have obtained updated drivers for your hardware devices and that you have the latest system BIOS (for an x86-based computer) or the correct firmware (for an Itanium-based computer). The device manufacturers can help you obtain these items. For information about the ACPI standard for the BIOS, see "Understanding the ACPI BIOS for an x86-Based Computer" later in this topic.</p>
                  <p>Finally, if you have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you are aware that your Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly to the standards, consider taking a device inventory of the hardware devices in your computer. For more information, see the next section, "Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play."</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play</h5>
                  <p>This section describes steps you can take if the devices in your computer do not use Plug and Play technology. For important information about hardware compatibility (including the compatibility of devices), be sure to read "System Requirements" and "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this topic. For specific information about using a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) with a driver that was supplied by the manufacturer, see the next section, "Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process."</p>
                  <p>Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family include Plug and Play technology so that devices (for example, video and network adapters) can be automatically recognized by the operating system, configuration conflicts are avoided, and you do not have to specify each device’s settings by hand. However, if you have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you are aware that your Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly to the standards, you might want to take steps to avoid device configuration conflicts. This section describes steps you can take, if you choose, to understand your device configuration before running Setup.</p>
                  <p>To take an inventory of your devices, use the existing operating system to obtain the current settings, such as memory address and interrupt request (IRQ), used with your devices. For example, with Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, you can use Control Panel to view settings (on the <b>Start </b>menu, point to <b>Settings</b>, click <b>Control Panel</b>, and then double-click icons such as <b>Network</b> and <b>Ports</b>). You might also choose to view system BIOS information. To do this, watch the screen while starting the computer, and then press the appropriate key when prompted.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of an upgrade, the Setup program automatically takes a device inventory as well. For devices that do not use Plug and Play, or that are not implemented exactly to Plug and Play standards, taking your own inventory helps prevent the following difficulties:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      If two or more adapters share IRQ settings or memory addresses, the Setup program might not be able to resolve the conflict. To prevent this, you can take one of two approaches. <br></br>
                      You can remove one of the adapters before running Setup and re-install it afterward. For information about installing and configuring adapters and other hardware devices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.<br></br>
                      As an alternative, you can modify one adapter’s IRQ settings and memory addresses before running Setup, so that each adapter’s settings are unique.<br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If adapters do not respond in a standard way to the attempts by Setup to detect or enumerate them, Setup might receive indecipherable or inaccurate information. In this case, you might need to remove these devices before running Setup, and re-install and configure them afterward. For information about installing and configuring adapters and other hardware devices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.<br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                  <p>The following table lists the kinds of information to gather if you have devices that do not use Plug and Play, and you decide to take a device inventory before starting Setup.</p>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process</h5>
                  <p>If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family by checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>
                  <p>If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.</p>
                  <p>If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files on the Setup CD, and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file, restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File</h5>
                  <p>If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6: at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts to include your HAL file in the Setup process.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Understanding the ACPI BIOS for an x86-Based Computer</h5>
                  <p>For an x86-based computer, the <i>basic input/output system (BIOS)</i> is a set of software through which the operating system (or Setup) communicates with the computer’s hardware devices. The <i>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</i> is the current standard for the way the BIOS works. Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family support not only ACPI-compliant BIOS versions, but also some BIOS versions based on older advanced power management (APM) and Plug and Play designs.</p>
                  <p>Some ACPI-based BIOS versions are not compliant with the standard. The more recent the version of an ACPI BIOS, the more likely that it is compliant. An ACPI-based BIOS that is not compliant with the ACPI standard might not support workable communication between the operating system (or Setup) and your hardware. If workable communication is not supported, Setup stops and displays instructions for contacting your hardware manufacturer and taking other steps to solve the problem. If this happens, follow the instructions provided.</p>
                  <p>To learn more about the ACPI compliance of your BIOS:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      For information about your BIOS version, before running Setup, restart the computer and watch the text on the screen. Pay particular attention to blocks of text containing the words "BIOS" or "ACPI BIOS." <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      For information about BIOS versions for your hardware, check your hardware documentation and contact your hardware manufacturer.<br></br>

                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files</h5>
                  <p>If you have a working Internet connection on the computer on which you run Setup, you can choose Dynamic Update during Setup and obtain the most up-to-date Setup files, including drivers and other files. Whenever an important update is made to any crucial Setup file, that update is made available through Dynamic Update functionality built into the Windows Update Web site. Some of the updated files will be replacements (for example, an updated driver or updated Setup file) and some will be additions (for example, a driver not available at the time that the Setup CD was created). It is recommended that you use Dynamic Update when running Setup.</p>
                  <p>Dynamic Update has been carefully designed so that it is reliable and easy to use:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      The files on the Dynamic Update section of the Windows Update Web site have been carefully tested and selected. Only files that are important in ensuring that Setup runs well are made available through Dynamic Update. Files with minor updates that will not significantly affect Setup are not part of Dynamic Update. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Because Dynamic Update downloads only the files that are required for your computer, the Dynamic Update software briefly examines your computer hardware. No personal information is collected, and no information is saved. The only purpose is to select appropriate drivers for your hardware configuration. This keeps the download as short as possible and ensures that only necessary drivers are downloaded to your hard disk. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      You can use Dynamic Update when running a preupgrade compatibility check from the product CD, or when running Setup itself. Either way, you obtain the most up-to-date files for running Setup. For information about running the compatibility check, see "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this topic. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      You can use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup. Preparing for this requires several steps. For a brief description of unattended Setup, see the "Planning for Unattended Setup" section in "<a href="#BKMK_2">Running Setup for an Upgrade</a>" later in this topic. For details about how to use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup (also called automated installation), see the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits Web site: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=29883" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=29883</a><br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                  <p>The Windows Update Web site offers a variety of updates that you can use after completing Setup. To learn more, go to: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=284" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=284</a></p>

          <p>At some point in your planning process, before you run Setup, familiarize yourself with the Relnotes.htm file found on the CD.</p>
          <p>This file contains important usage information about hardware, networking, applications, and printing. Also familiarize yourself with information about hardware compatibility for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family.

      <a name="UpgradesinaDomainContainingWindows2000DomainControllers"></a><A name="EFDBLBHA"></A><h3 class="subHeading">Upgrades in a Domain Containing Windows 2000 Domain Controllers</h3><div class="subSection">
          <p>If you are upgrading servers in a domain containing Windows&#160;2000 domain controllers, there are a few points to keep in mind. The following points are the most important:</p>
          <ul><li>
              The first step in planning the upgrade of a particular server is to check the compatibility of the hardware with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. For more information, see "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this topic. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              Before you upgrade the first domain controller in a domain where one or more domain controllers run Windows&#160;2000, or add a domain controller running a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, you must prepare the domain (and the forest in which it is located) using a simple tool on the Setup CD for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. For information, see "Preparing for Upgrades in a Domain Containing Windows&#160;2000 Domain Controllers" later in this topic. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              Before preparing the domain (and the forest in which it is located), it is recommended that you apply Service Pack&#160;2 or later to all domain controllers running Windows&#160;2000.<br></br>
            </li><li>
              If you have Internet&#160;Information Services (IIS)&#160;5.0 installed on a server, when you upgrade the operating system, IIS is upgraded to IIS&#160;6.0. However, for application compatibility, IIS runs in IIS&#160;5.0 isolation mode after the upgrade. For more information about IIS isolation modes, see the IIS&#160;6.0 Help. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              The Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled by default when you upgrade. The security settings in this configuration can help make your computer more secure by limiting its exposure to malicious Web sites. Therefore, with this enhanced level of security, you might find that some Web sites do not display correctly in Internet Explorer when you are browsing Internet and intranet Web sites. Also, you might be prompted to enter your credentials when accessing network resources, such as files in Universal Naming Convention (UNC) shared folders. You can easily change the enhanced security settings. For more information, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>). <br></br>
            </li><li>
              After upgrading the first server, you can read topics in Help and Support Center about the features that are most useful to you in products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. <br></br>
              One concept to read about is domain and forest functional levels, which are levels of Active Directory functionality related to the mix of operating system versions on your domain controllers. As you complete domain controller upgrades and reduce the number of different operating system versions running on them, you can adjust the domain and forest functional levels appropriately.<br></br>
              To view Help and Support Center on a server running Windows Server&#160;2003, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.<br></br>
            </li></ul>
          <p>If you have servers running Windows&#160;NT, also review the following points:</p>
          <ul><li>
              Before running Setup, it is recommended that you review the file systems and partitions that exist on the server. You must have at least one NTFS partition on domain controllers. It is recommended that you use NTFS on all partitions on all the servers in the domain, because any FAT or FAT32 partition lacks many security features. For example, on FAT or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can be protected only by the permissions set on that shared folder, not on individual files, and there is no software protection against local access to the partition. For more information, see "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS" in "<a href="#BKMK_4">Getting Ready for a New Installation</a>" later in this topic.<br></br>
            </li><li>
              If some of your domain controllers run Windows&#160;2000 and some run Windows&#160;NT, it is recommended that you upgrade the Windows&#160;NT&#160; domain controllers as soon as is practical, to reduce the number of version differences between computers, simplify management and troubleshooting, and strengthen security. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              Before you begin an upgrade from Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, you must apply Service Pack&#160;5 or later. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              If you have servers or client computers that run Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51, it is recommended that you install or upgrade to a newer operating system on all these computers, or retire them from operation. If you have more than one domain, you must upgrade domain controllers running Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51 for reliable logon validation. In any case, upgrading or retiring computers running Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51 strengthens security and reduces the number of version differences between computers, simplifying management and troubleshooting.<br></br>
            </li></ul>
          <p>After the domain and forest are prepared, there are two stages in the upgrade of a domain controller. First you run Setup to upgrade the operating system and then, when Setup is complete, you run the Active Directory Installation Wizard (which appears on the screen the first time you log on).</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Preparing for Upgrades in a Domain Containing Windows&#160;2000 Domain Controllers</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Before beginning the first domain controller upgrade in a domain where one or more domain controllers run Windows&#160;2000, you must first prepare the domain and the forest in which it is located. After preparing the domain, you can begin the domain upgrade through either of the following approaches:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  Upgrade an existing domain controller to a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. (Be sure to check hardware compatibility first, as described in "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this topic.) <br></br>
                  If you attempt to upgrade the first domain controller and you have not yet prepared the domain and the forest, Setup stops and a pop-up provides instructions.<br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on a member server in the domain, and start the Active Directory Installation Wizard to change the member server into a domain controller. <br></br>
                  If you install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on a member server in the domain and start the Active Directory Installation Wizard, but you have not yet prepared the domain and the forest, the wizard stops and a pop-up provides instructions.<br></br>
                </li></ul>
              <p>For additional background information about this type of domain upgrade, see the previous section, "Upgrades in a Domain Containing Windows&#160;2000 Domain Controllers."</p>

              <p>There are three stages to the process of upgrading servers in a domain where all the domain controllers run Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0:</p>
              <p>
                <b>Basic preparations</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;There are a small number of basic preparations you must carry out before upgrading servers to a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, such as confirming hardware compatibility and reviewing the partitioning of the disks on the servers. For more information, see "Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a Windows&#160;NT Domain" later in this topic.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Planning server roles and the order in which to upgrade servers</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;Planning server roles and the order in which to upgrade servers involves understanding the server roles available, as well as deciding when to upgrade domain controllers in relation to member servers:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  The server roles available for servers running Windows&#160;NT are slightly different than for servers running Windows Server&#160;2003. Also, in contrast with servers running Windows&#160;NT, you can change the role of a server running Windows Server&#160;2003 without reinstalling the operating system. For more information, see "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from Windows&#160;NT" later in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the first Windows&#160;NT server you upgrade is a member server, many features become available immediately. For information about reasons for upgrading a particular member server early in the process, see "Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows&#160;NT Domain" later in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  When you upgrade the primary domain controller, many Active Directory features become available (in addition to all the other features in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family). For information about how these features can simplify administration, see "Features Available with the First Domain Controller Upgrade in a Windows&#160;NT Domain" later in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  However, the upgrade to Active Directory also involves some advance planning. For information about the planning necessary before upgrading to Active Directory, see "Planning DNS for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0" later in this topic.<br></br>

                  </td></tr></table>
                </li></ul>
              <p>
                <b>Performing backups and carrying out the upgrade process</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;There are a few preparations to make just before beginning the upgrades, such as ensuring that you have applied Service Pack&#160;5 or later, and performing backups:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  For information about the preparations to make just before beginning the upgrade, see "Applying the Service Pack, Performing Backups, and Other Preparations" later in this topic. <br></br>

            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a Windows&#160;NT Domain</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>There are a small number of basic preparations you must carry out to lay the groundwork for upgrading servers in a domain where all the domain controllers run Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0. For information about how these preparations fit into the overall process of the upgrade, see "Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 Domain" earlier in this topic.</p>

                <p>If you have servers or client computers that run Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51, it is recommended that you install or upgrade to a newer operating system on all these computers, or retire them from operation. If you have more than one domain, you must upgrade domain controllers running Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51 for reliable logon validation. In any case, upgrading or retiring computers running Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51 strengthens security and reduces the number of version differences between computers, simplifying management and troubleshooting.</p>
              </td></tr></table>
              <p>
                <b>Compatibility check</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;Check to see whether the applications and hardware on your systems are compatible with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, and then update or replace them as necessary. For important details about how to do this, see "Hardware Compatibility" and "Important Files to Review" earlier in this topic.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Review partition sizes, especially on domain controllers</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;Review the partitions on the servers to make sure there is plenty of free space available for the Windows Server operating system to run. It is especially important to allow plenty of free space on domain controllers, because the existing user accounts database can expand by as much as a factor of ten when Active Directory functionality is added. For information about the disk requirements for the operating system, see "System Requirements" earlier in this topic.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Review file systems on server partitions</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;You must have at least one NTFS partition on domain controllers. It is recommended that you use NTFS on all partitions on all the servers in the domain, because any FAT or FAT32 partition lacks many security features. For example, on FAT or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can be protected only by the permissions set on the shared folder, not on individual files, and there is no software protection against local access to the partition. For more information, see "Choosing a File System for the Installation Partition" and "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS" in "<a href="#BKMK_4">Getting Ready for a New Installation</a>" later in this topic.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Service pack</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;Obtain Service Pack&#160;5 or later, because it is necessary for the upgrade.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Mirror sets or other disk sets</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;If you used Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer, you must prepare the disk set first. For details, see "Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" later in this topic.</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity</h5>
                  <p>With the disk management technologies in Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, you could create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using the dynamic disk technology introduced with Windows&#160;2000, you can use similar technologies, with the added flexibility of being able to extend disk volumes without repartitioning or reformatting.</p>
                  <p>This transition from the technologies used in Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 means that you must make certain choices before running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. Any volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity that you created with Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 are not supported in Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, although they were supported to a limited extent in Windows&#160;2000.</p>
                  <p>If you used Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer, you must choose one of the following methods.</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>For a mirror set, break the mirror</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you are running Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 on a computer that has a mirror set and you want to run Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer, first back up the data (as a safeguard &#8212; the data will not be erased) and then break the mirror. Ensure that you have applied Service Pack&#160;5 or later, required before running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. Then run Setup.</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up the data and delete the set</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you are running Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 on a computer that has a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on that computer, first back up the data. Next, delete the set (which will delete the data). Ensure that you have applied Service Pack&#160;5 or later, required before running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. Then run Setup.</p>
                  <p>After running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up data as necessary, and make use of the volume options shown in the table later in this section.

          <h4 class="subHeading">Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from Windows&#160;NT</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>This section provides a list of basic guidelines to use when planning server roles and the order of server upgrades in a domain where all the domain controllers run Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0. For information about how this planning fits into the overall process of the upgrade, see "Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 Domain" earlier in this topic.</p>
              <p>Use the following guidelines when planning server roles and the order of server upgrades from Windows&#160;NT:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  Familiarize yourself with the slight differences between the naming of server roles for servers running Windows&#160;NT as compared to servers running Windows Server&#160;2003: <br></br>
                  <ul><li>
                      In Windows&#160;NT, there are two kinds of domain controllers, the primary domain controller, which is limited to one per domain and contains a read-write database, and backup domain controller, which is not limited in number and contains a read-only database. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      For domain controllers running Windows Server&#160;2003, there is only one kind of domain controller, without a "primary" or "backup" designation. All domain controllers contain matching copies of the user accounts and other Active Directory data in a given domain, and provide read-write access to that data. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      In addition to domain controllers, the possible roles for either operating system include member server, which belongs to a domain but does not contain a copy of the Active Directory data, and stand-alone server, which belongs to a workgroup instead of a domain.<br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                </li><li>
                  Note that in contrast with Windows&#160;NT, you can change the role of a server without rerunning Setup. However, as a general practice, it is best to plan the roles ahead of time and change them only as necessary. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  As was true with Windows&#160;NT, a domain must have at least one domain controller, but it is recommended that a domain have multiple domain controllers for resilience in the handling of logon requests and directory updates. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the features you need most are not Active Directory features, you can focus on upgrading member servers first. For information about reasons for upgrading a particular member server early in the process, see "Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows&#160;NT Domain" later in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the features you need most are Active Directory features, focus on upgrading domain controllers first, and carry out the advance planning that is necessary for this part of the upgrade. <br></br>
                </li></ul>

                <p>When you begin the upgrade of domain controllers running Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, you must upgrade the primary domain controller first.</p>

              <ul><li>
                  When you begin upgrading domain controllers, if you have a remote access server that is a member server, it is recommended that you upgrade it before the last domain controller is upgraded. Such a server is dependent on domain controllers for user information, and therefore should not be "left behind" when domain controllers are upgraded. As an alternative, you can weaken the security permissions in Active Directory so that the remote access server running Windows&#160;NT can read user attributes from the domain controllers running products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. <br></br>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Planning DNS for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0</h5>
                  <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. This section describes the planning for DNS that is recommended before you upgrade to Active Directory, that is, before you upgrade the primary domain controller in a Windows&#160;NT domain to become a domain controller running Windows Server&#160;2003.</p>
                  <p>DNS is the name resolution service used by Active Directory. Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family can support both the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) common in Windows&#160;NT networks, and DNS. You must deploy DNS to support Active Directory. You can choose to migrate from WINS to DNS or configure your new DNS infrastructure to support your current WINS infrastructure.</p>
                  <p>For the upgrading of a network with one to five servers and 100 or fewer clients (which is the size of network discussed in this manual), only a simple DNS plan is needed, because there will be no parent or child domains. DNS names consist of name labels separated by periods. A simple DNS domain name for a Windows Server&#160;2003 family domain could take the form <i>domainname.ext</i> where <i>ext</i> is an established "top-level domain" type such as <b>com</b> or <b>org</b>. With a domain name of that form, the form of a computer name in the domain would be:</p>
                  <p>
                    <i>computername.domainname.ext</i>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you upgrade the primary domain controller in a Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 domain (the primary domain controller must be upgraded first, before backup domain controllers), you will be offered several different options for the handling of DNS. If there is no DNS server available to work with Active Directory, you will be offered, by default, the option of installing DNS on the domain controller you are upgrading (formerly the primary domain controller). In a network with one to five servers, the simplest approach is to accept this default. Then, after completing the upgrade of the server on which DNS was installed, take note of its static IP address, and configure other computers to send any DNS requests to that IP address. For additional basic information about DNS and how to configure it during Setup, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" in "<a href="#BKMK_4">Getting Ready for a New Installation</a>" later in this topic. For more detailed information about DNS, see the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits Web site at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=29883" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=29883</a></p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Performing Backups and Carrying out Upgrades of Domain Controllers Running Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>There are a few preparations to make just before beginning an upgrade from Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, such as ensuring that you have applied Service Pack&#160;5 or later, and performing backups. During the upgrade, there are a few choices to make for the upgrade of a network of two to five servers (a network within the size of those discussed in this manual). The following sections describe these final preparations and provide guidelines for making choices.</p>
              <p>Before beginning this stage of the upgrade process, be sure to review "Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a Windows&#160;NT Domain" and "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from Windows&#160;NT" earlier in this topic.</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Applying the Service Pack, Performing Backups, and Other Preparations</h5>
                  <p>Before beginning an upgrade of servers in a domain where all the domain controllers run Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, apply an appropriate Service Pack, perform backups, and consider whether to remove a backup domain controller temporarily from the network:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      Be sure that you have applied Service Pack&#160;5 or later to the servers. You must apply Service Pack&#160;5 or later before you can begin an upgrade from Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      As with any major change to the contents of hard disks on your servers, it is recommended that you back up each server before upgrading it. Also be sure to review "Preparing Your System for an Upgrade" in "<a href="#BKMK_2">Running Setup for an Upgrade</a>" later in this topic.<br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If you are preparing to upgrade the primary domain controller, to protect your existing network integrity, consider removing a backup domain controller temporarily from the network. To do this, in your existing Windows&#160;NT network, choose a backup domain controller, ensure that it has a current copy of the user accounts database, and back it up. Then disconnect its network cable. After the upgrade of your primary domain controller to become a domain controller running Windows Server&#160;2003 (you must upgrade the primary domain controller first), this disconnected system is available for promotion to a Windows&#160;NT primary domain controller if necessary. However, in the course of an uneventful upgrade, you would not and could not promote the Windows&#160;NT backup domain controller to primary domain controller. Instead, you would continue the upgrade process, eventually reconnecting the disconnected server and upgrading it.<br></br>

The database and the log file can be on any kind of partition (FAT, FAT32, or NTFS); the database can expand by as much as a factor of ten from the size it had with Windows&#160;NT, so allow plenty of room for it. (Initially, the log file will take up very little space.) The system volume folder must be on an NTFS partition.

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Completing Further Upgrades from Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0</h5>
                  <p>After you upgrade your primary domain controller and ensure that it is functioning to your satisfaction, you can begin the upgrade of any backup domain controllers. (You can upgrade member servers at any time.)</p>
                  <p>Upgrade the backup domain controllers one at a time (ensure that each is backed up before upgrading). Before beginning the upgrade of each backup domain controller, make sure that at least one domain controller running Windows Server&#160;2003 is available on the network, because the user accounts and other Active Directory data will be copied from the domain controllers that have already been upgraded. Start and test each server on the network to ensure that it is functioning to your satisfaction before upgrading another backup domain controller.</p>
                  <p>An upgraded domain controller will appear as a Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 primary domain controller to Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 servers and client computers. However, it is recommended that you complete the upgrade of all servers in the domain relatively quickly (rather than allowing a long delay). This reduces the number of version differences between computers, simplifying management and troubleshooting, and also strengthens security.</p>
                  <p>The Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled by default when you upgrade. The security settings in this configuration can help make your computer more secure by limiting its exposure to malicious Web sites. Therefore, with this enhanced level of security, you might find that some Web sites do not display correctly in Internet Explorer when you are browsing Internet and intranet Web sites. Also, you might be prompted to enter your credentials when accessing network resources, such as files in Universal Naming Convention (UNC) shared folders. You can easily change the enhanced security settings. For more information, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>).</p>
                  <p>If you have a remote access server that is a <i>member</i> server, it is recommended that you upgrade it before the last domain controller is upgraded. For more information, see "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from Windows&#160;NT" earlier in this topic.</p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Backing Up Files</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Before upgrading, it is recommended that you back up your current files, including anything containing configuration information, for example, the System State and the system and boot partitions. You can back up files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or the hard disk of another computer on the network.</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets for an Upgrade (Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 only)</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>With the disk management technologies in Windows&#160;NT&#174;&#160;4.0, you could create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using dynamic disks, introduced with Windows&#160;2000, you can take advantage of similar technologies, and with Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, you can also extend dynamic volumes without repartitioning or reformatting.</p>
              <p>This transition from the technologies used in Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 means that you must make certain choices before running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. For important information about these choices, see the "Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" section in "Getting Ready for an Upgrade" at the beginning of this document.</p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Reviewing Hardware and Software</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>When you start Setup for an upgrade, the first process it carries out is a check for compatible hardware and software on your computer. Setup displays a report before continuing. Use this report, along with information in Relnotes.htm (on the Setup CD), to find out whether you need to update your hardware, drivers, or software before upgrading.</p>
              <p>Confirm that your hardware and software is designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family by checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>

                  <p>If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family by checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>
                  <p>If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.</p>
                  <p>If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file, restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.</p>

      <a name="ProductActivationforProductsintheWindowsServer2003Family2"></a><A name="EFJBJBHA"></A><h3 class="subHeading">Product Activation for Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 Family</h3><div class="subSection">
          <p>After you install a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This results in better products and more innovation for customers.</p>
          <p>The following details help explain product activation:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Software reminders</b>
          </p>
          <p>Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function, except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop for Administration (the new name for the Windows&#160;2000 functionality known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>How the software handles activation</b>
          </p>
          <p>Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product, it means that your product key is now associated with the computer (the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network).</p>
          <p>Your local operating system does some of the work for creating the association between your product key and the computer it is installed on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key, and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer (without representing any personal information or anything about the software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person’s activation will not work.</p>
          <p>The Installation ID that the local operating system generates, representing the association between your product key and the computer it is installed on, is used only for the purpose of activation.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Methods for activation</b>
          </p>
          <p>After your operating system is installed, begin activation by clicking <b>Start</b> and then clicking <b>Activate Windows</b> (you can also click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the screen). By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate through the Internet or by phone:</p>
          <ul><li>
              
                <b>Internet:</b> When you activate through the Internet, your computer transmits coded information that shows that your product key is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is passed back to your computer, automatically activating your product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to complete. No personally identifiable information is required to activate your product. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              
                <b>Phone:</b> When you activate by phone, information on the screen guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the country or region where you are located, a phone number (toll-free, wherever possible) appears on your screen. When you call the number, a customer service representative asks for the Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The customer service representative enters that number into a secure database, confirms that the number represents a legally installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then, you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the screen, and activation is complete.<br></br>
            </li></ul>
          <p>
            <b>Reactivation (rarely needed)</b>
          </p>
          <p>If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick, simple process, you can reactivate your product.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Product Activation Compared to Product Registration</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Product activation is not the same as product registration. As discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional, and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive information about product updates and special offers directly from Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely, and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.</p>

          <p>With Microsoft&#174; Windows&#160;Server&#8482;&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, and Windows Server&#160;2003, Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering to ensure that users have constant access to important server-based resources. With clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node begins to provide service (a process known as failover). Critical applications and resources remain continuously available.</p>

          <p>If you are upgrading from Windows&#160;2000 to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on cluster nodes, you might be able to perform a <i>rolling upgrade</i> of the operating system. In a rolling upgrade, you sequentially upgrade the operating system on each node, making sure that one node is always available to handle client requests. When you upgrade the operating system, the Cluster service is automatically upgraded also. A rolling upgrade maximizes availability of clustered services and minimizes administrative complexity. For more information, see the next section "How Rolling Upgrades Work."</p>
          <p>To determine whether you can perform a rolling upgrade, and understand the effect that a rolling upgrade might have on your clustered resources, see "Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades" later in this topic. For information about ways to upgrade your cluster nodes if you cannot perform a rolling upgrade, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows&#160;2000" later in this topic.</p>
          <p>If you are upgrading from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0, Enterprise Edition, to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on cluster nodes, you cannot perform a rolling upgrade. For more information about how to perform an upgrade from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0, Enterprise Edition, see "Upgrading a Cluster from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0 to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition," later in this topic.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">How Rolling Upgrades Work</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>This section describes rolling upgrades on server clusters. For information about methods, restrictions, and alternatives to rolling upgrades, see the sections that follow this section.</p>
              <p>There are two major advantages to a rolling upgrade. First, there is a minimal interruption of service to clients. (However, server response time might decrease during the phases in which a fewer number of nodes handle the work of the entire cluster.) Second, you do not have to recreate your cluster configuration. The configuration remains intact during the upgrade process.</p>
              <p>The four phases are described in the following section.</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Phases of a Rolling Upgrade</h5>
                  <p>A rolling upgrade starts with two cluster nodes that are running Windows&#160;2000. In this example, they are named <i>Node 1</i> and <i>Node 2</i>:</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Phase 1: Preliminary</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>Each node runs Windows&#160;2000 Advanced Server with the following software:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      The Cluster service component (one of the optional components of Windows&#160;2000 Advanced Server). <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Applications that support a rolling upgrade. For more information, see the application documentation, and "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this topic.<br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                  <p>At this point, your cluster is configured so that each node handles client requests (an active/active configuration).</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Phase 2: Upgrade Node 1</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>Node 1 is paused, and Node 2 handles all cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system of Node 1 to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition.</p>
                  <p>You are now running a <i>mixed-version</i> cluster. A mixed-version cluster is a cluster in which the nodes are running different versions of the operating system. Although mixed-version clusters are supported by Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, they are not the optimal configuration. It is recommended that you upgrade all nodes to the same operating system by completing the final two phases of the rolling upgrade.</p>
                  <p>When your cluster is in a mixed version state, it is recommended that you do not make any changes to the cluster configuration, such as adding or removing nodes. It is also recommended that you do not make changes to any of the cluster resources while your cluster is in a mixed version state.</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Phase 3: Upgrade Node 2</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>Node 1 rejoins the cluster. Node 2 is paused and Node 1 handles all cluster resource groups while you upgrade the operating system on Node 2.</p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Phase 4: Final</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>Node 2 rejoins the cluster, and you redistribute the resource groups back to the active/active cluster configuration.</p>
                  <table class="alertTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="txtCell">Important </td></tr><tr><td class="alertCell"><ul>
                    <li>If your goal is to have more than two nodes in the cluster, you must use Fibre Channel (not SCSI) for the cluster storage.

                  <p>For an outline of the rolling upgrade process, see the preceding section "How Rolling Upgrades Work." To perform the following procedure, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority. If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be able to perform this procedure. As a security best practice, consider using <b>Run as</b> to perform this procedure. <b>Run as</b> is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands or programs using a different security context. For example, you can log on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more information in Windows&#160;2000 about <b>Run as</b>, on a server running Windows&#160;2000, click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Help</b>, click the Search tab and then search for <b>runas</b>.</p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Restrictions on Rolling Upgrades</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>There are several basic restrictions to the rolling-upgrade process. The most basic restrictions are as follows:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  You can perform a rolling upgrade only if you are upgrading from Windows&#160;2000 on the cluster nodes. You cannot perform a rolling upgrade if you are upgrading from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0, Enterprise Edition. For a description of the ways to upgrade from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0, see "Upgrading a Cluster from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0 to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition," later in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  You cannot mix x86-based and Itanium-based computers within the same cluster. Also, you cannot mix x86-based and x64-based computers within the same cluster. Therefore, you cannot perform a rolling upgrade from an x86-based computer to either an Itanium-based or x64-based computer.<br></br>
                </li></ul>
              <p>The remaining restrictions involve the beginning of Phase 3, in which you operate a mixed-version cluster: a cluster in which the nodes run different versions of the operating system. The operation of a mixed-version cluster is complicated if a resource type that you add to the cluster is supported in one version of the operating system but not the other. For example, the Cluster service in Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, supports the Generic Script resource type. However, older versions of the Cluster service do not support it.</p>
              <p>A mixed-version cluster can run a Generic Script resource on a node running Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, but not on a node running Windows&#160;2000. The Cluster service transparently sets the possible owners of new resource types to prevent these resources from failing over to a Windows&#160;2000 node of a mixed-version cluster. In other words, when you view the possible owners of a new resource type, a Windows&#160;2000 node will not be in the list, and you will not be able to add this node to the list. If you create such a resource during the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, the resource groups containing those resources will not fail over to a Windows&#160;2000 node.</p>
              <p>In order for a mixed-version cluster to work, the different versions of the software running on each node must be prepared to communicate with one another. This requirement leads to several basic restrictions on the rolling-upgrade process.</p>
              <ul><li>
                  For a successful rolling upgrade, every resource that the cluster manages must be capable of a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "Resource Behavior During Rolling Upgrades" later in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  During the mixed-version phase of a rolling upgrade, when the cluster nodes are running different versions of the operating system, do not change the settings of resources (for example, do not change the settings of a printer resource).<br></br>
                </li></ul>
              <p>If the preceding restriction cannot be met, do not perform a rolling upgrade. For more information, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows&#160;2000" later in this topic.</p>

              <p>When your cluster is in a mixed version state, it is recommended that you do not make any changes to the cluster configuration, such as adding or removing nodes. It is also recommended that you do not make changes to any of the cluster resources while your cluster is in a mixed version state.</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Upgrades That Include a Print Spooler Resource</h5>
                  <p>If you want to perform a rolling upgrade of a cluster that has a Print Spooler resource, you must consider two issues.</p>
                  <p>First, the Print Spooler resource only supports upgrades (including rolling upgrades or any other kind of upgrade) of printers on cluster-supported ports (LPR or Standard Port Monitor ports). For information about what to do if your printer is not supported, see "Alternatives to Rolling Upgrades from Windows&#160;2000" later in this topic.</p>
                  <p>Second, when you operate a mixed-version cluster including a Print Spooler resource, note the following:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      Do not change printer settings in a mixed-version cluster with a Print Spooler resource. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Avoid adding new printers while you are performing a rolling upgrade. If you do add a new printer, when you install the drivers for that printer, be sure to install both the driver for Windows&#160;2000 and the driver for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on all nodes. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If printing preferences or defaults are important, be sure to check them. Printing preferences in Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, will not be necessarily correspond to document defaults for the same printer in Windows&#160;2000. This can be affected by differences in the drivers for the two operating systems.<br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                  <p>When the rolling upgrade is complete and both cluster nodes are running the updated operating system, you can make any modifications you choose to your printer configuration.</p>

                  <p>IIS 6.0 is not supported during rolling upgrades. To upgrade a clustered IIS resource, you must replace the existing IIS resource with a Generic Script Resource. You have two options to do this; you can perform each of the steps as described in the following procedure, or you can use a script that is supplied with Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, which automates many of the steps. The instructions for using the script are described in the second procedure. To perform either of the following procedures, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority. If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be able to perform these procedures. As a security best practice, consider using <b>Run as</b> to perform either of these procedures. <b>Run as</b> is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands or programs using a different security context. For example, you can log on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more information in Windows&#160;2000 about <b>Run as</b>, on a server running Windows&#160;2000, click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Help</b>, click the <b>Search </b>tab, and then search for <b>runas</b>.</p>

                  <p>If you have other resources on your cluster such as DHCP and WINS that are not fully supported during a rolling upgrade and are not described by other technology specific procedures listed previously (such as IIS), you can perform a "last node rolling upgrade"</p>
                  <p>Last node rolling upgrades are similar to standard rolling upgrades. In a last node rolling upgrade, you upgrade all nodes except the node that contains the unsupported resources. After all other nodes are upgraded, you then upgrade the final node containing the identified resources.</p>
                  <p>Last node rolling upgrades are a way to accommodate resources that cannot fail over to an older operating system from a node running Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. Be aware that these resources can, however, fail over the other way, that is, from the older operating system to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition.</p>
                  <p>To perform the following procedure, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority. If the computer is joined to a domain, members of the Domain Admins group might be able to perform this procedure. As a security best practice, consider using Run as to perform this procedure. Run as is a secondary logon method that you can use to start commands or programs using a different security context. For example, you can log on as a member of the Users group and, without logging off, run a command as a member of the Administrators group. To find more information in Windows&#160;2000 about <b>Run as</b>, on a server running Windows&#160;2000, click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Help</b>, click the <b>Search</b> tab, and then search for <b>runas</b>.</p>

          <p>You cannot perform a rolling upgrade directly from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0, Enterprise Edition, to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. You instead have two options:</p>
          <ul><li>
              You can maintain cluster availability by performing an upgrade first to Windows&#160;2000, and then to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. If you use this method, perform an upgrade from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0 to Windows&#160;2000 as documented in the Windows&#160;2000 documentation. Then follow the procedures documented in "Upgrading a Cluster from Windows&#160;2000 to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition," earlier in this topic. If you have an IIS resource on your Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0 cluster, after you complete both upgrades, you must delete the unsupported IIS resource type by opening the <b>Command Prompt</b> and typing the following command: <br></br>
              
                <b>Cluster restype “IIS Virtual Root” /delete /type</b>
              <br></br>
            </li><li>
              You can perform a nonrolling upgrade directly from Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0 to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, which will not allow you to maintain cluster availability.<br></br>

The steps you perform depend on what resources are included in your cluster. For many installations, the following procedure, "To upgrade directly from Windows&#160;NT Server 4.0 to Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition," is appropriate.

You cannot correct this problem by granting the user right to a security group of which the user account is a member. Typically, you must grant this user right as a local user right; it cannot be a domain-level user right. However, if your node is a domain controller, you can use the domain level user right.

          <p>This section compares upgrading to performing a new installation, to help you confirm your decision to perform a new installation. <i>Upgrading</i> is either replacing Microsoft Windows&#160;NT&#174;&#160;4.0 (with Service Pack&#160;5 or later) with a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, or replacing Windows&#160;2000 with a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. <i>Installing</i>, in contrast with upgrading, means completely removing the previous operating system, or installing a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family on a disk or disk partition with no previous operating system.</p>
          <p>The following lists describe items to consider when deciding between an upgrade and a new installation:</p>
        
          <div class="subSection">
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Points to consider for an upgrade:</h5>
                  <ul><li>
                      With an upgrade, configuration is simpler, and your existing users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are retained. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      With an upgrade, you do not need to re-install files and applications. As with any major changes to the hard disk, however, it is recommended that you back up the disk before beginning an upgrade. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Before beginning an upgrade, read "Getting Ready for an Upgrade" at the beginning of this document.<br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If you want to upgrade and then use the same applications as before, be sure to review applications information in Relnotes.htm (on the Setup CD). Also, for the most recent information about compatible applications for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, see the software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37604" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37604</a><br></br>

                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Points to consider for a new installation:</h5>
                  <ul><li>
                      If you reformat your hard disk and then perform a new installation, the efficiency of your disk might improve (compared to not reformatting it). Reformatting also gives you the opportunity to modify the size or number of disk partitions, to make them match your requirements more closely. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      If you want to practice careful configuration management, for example, for a server where high availability is important, you might want to perform a new installation on that server instead of an upgrade. This is especially true on servers on which the operating system has been upgraded several times in the past. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      It is possible to install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, and also allow the computer to sometimes run another operating system. Setting up the computer this way, however, presents complexities because of file system issues. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating System" later in this topic.<br></br>

                    <p>The setup process requires the free disk space described in the previous paragraph. After Setup is finished, actual hard disk space used for the operating system will be more than the free space required for Setup, because of space needed for the paging file, for any optional components you install, and (on domain controllers) for user accounts and other Active Directory&#174; information. The usual size for the paging file is 1.5 times the size of the RAM.

          <h4 class="subHeading">Hardware Compatibility</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>One of the most important steps to take before installing a server is to confirm that your hardware is compatible with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. You can do this by running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD or by checking the hardware compatibility information at the Windows Catalog Web site. Also, as part of confirming hardware compatibility, check to see that you have obtained updated hardware device drivers and an updated system BIOS (or for an Itanium-based computer, the correct firmware).</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether you run a preinstallation compatibility check, Setup checks hardware and software compatibility at the beginning of an installation and displays a report if there are incompatibilities.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD</b>
              </p>
              <p>You can run a hardware and software compatibility check from the Setup CD. The compatibility check does not require you to actually begin an installation. To run the check, insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive and, when a display appears, follow the prompts for checking system compatibility. You will be offered the option to download the latest Setup files (through Dynamic Update) when you run the check. If you have Internet connectivity, it is recommended that you allow the download.</p>
              <p>For more information about downloading the latest Setup files, see "Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files" later in this topic.</p>
              <p>Another way to run the compatibility check is to insert the Setup CD in the CD-ROM drive, open a command prompt, and type:</p>
              <p>
                <i>d</i>:<b>\i386\winnt32 /checkupgradeonly</b></p>
              <p>where <i>d</i> represents the CD-ROM drive.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Checking hardware and software compatibility information on the Microsoft Web site</b>
              </p>
              <p>Another way to confirm that your hardware and software are designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family is to check the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>
              <p>Note that one type of hardware no longer supported is the microchannel bus.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Checking drivers and system BIOS or firmware</b>
              </p>
              <p>Check that you have obtained updated drivers for your hardware devices and that you have the latest system BIOS (for an x86-based computer) or the correct firmware (for an Itanium-based computer). The device manufacturers can help you obtain these items. For information about the ACPI standard for the BIOS, see "Understanding the ACPI BIOS for an x86-Based Computer" later in this topic.</p>
              <p>Finally, if you have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you are aware that your Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly to the standards, consider taking a device inventory of the hardware devices in your computer. For more information, see the next section, "Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play."</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Taking an Inventory of Devices That Do Not Use Plug and Play</h5>
                  <p>This section describes steps you can take if the devices in your computer do not use Plug and Play technology. For important information about hardware compatibility (including the compatibility of devices), be sure to read "System Requirements" and "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this topic. For specific information about using a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) with a driver that was supplied by the manufacturer, see the next section, "Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process."</p>
                  <p>Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family include Plug and Play technology so that devices (for example, video and network adapters) can be automatically recognized by the operating system, configuration conflicts are avoided, and you do not have to specify each device’s settings by hand. However, if you have devices that do not use Plug and Play, or you are aware that your Plug and Play devices are not implemented exactly to the standards, you might want to take steps to avoid device configuration conflicts. This section describes steps you can take, if you choose, to understand your device configuration before running Setup.</p>
                  <p>To take an inventory of your devices, if your computer has an existing operating system, use it to obtain the current settings, such as memory address and interrupt request (IRQ), used with your devices. For example, with Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, you can use Control Panel to view settings (on the <b>Start</b> menu, point to <b>Settings</b>, click <b>Control Panel</b>, and then double-click icons such as <b>Network</b> and <b>Ports</b>). You might also choose to view system BIOS information. To do this, watch the screen while starting the computer, and then press the appropriate key when prompted.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of an installation, the Setup program automatically takes a device inventory as well. For devices that do not use Plug and Play, or that are not implemented exactly to Plug and Play standards, taking your own inventory helps prevent the following difficulties:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      If two or more adapters share IRQ settings or memory addresses, the Setup program might not be able to resolve the conflict. To prevent this, you can take one of two approaches. <br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                  <p>You can remove one of the adapters before running Setup and re-install it afterward. For information about installing and configuring adapters and other hardware devices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>
                  <p>As an alternative, you can modify one adapter’s IRQ settings and memory addresses before running Setup, so that each adapter’s settings are unique.</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      If adapters do not respond in a standard way to the attempts by Setup to detect or enumerate them, Setup might receive indecipherable or inaccurate information. In this case, you might need to remove these devices before running Setup, and re-install and configure them afterward. For information about installing and configuring adapters and other hardware devices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.<br></br>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process</h5>
                  <p>If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family by checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>
                  <p>If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.</p>
                  <p>If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files on the Setup CD, and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file, restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.</p>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Understanding the ACPI BIOS for an x86-Based Computer</h5>
                  <p>For an x86-based computer, the basic input/output system (BIOS) is a set of software through which the operating system (or Setup) communicates with the computer’s hardware devices. The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is the current standard for the way the BIOS works. Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family support not only ACPI-compliant BIOS versions, but also some BIOS versions based on older advanced power management (APM) and Plug and Play designs.</p>
                  <p>Some ACPI-based BIOS versions are not compliant with the standard. A more recent version of an ACPI BIOS is more likely to be compliant. An ACPI-based BIOS that is not compliant with the ACPI standard might not support workable communication between the operating system (or Setup) and your hardware. If workable communication is not supported, Setup stops and displays instructions for contacting your hardware manufacturer and taking other steps to solve the problem. If this happens, follow the instructions provided.</p>
                  <p>To learn more about the ACPI compliance of your BIOS:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      For information about your BIOS version, before running Setup, restart the computer and watch the text on the screen. Pay particular attention to blocks of text containing the words "BIOS" or "ACPI BIOS." <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      For information about BIOS versions for your hardware, check your hardware documentation and contact your hardware manufacturer.<br></br>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files</h5>
                  <p>If you have a working Internet connection on the computer on which you run Setup, you can choose Dynamic Update during Setup and obtain the most up-to-date Setup files, including drivers and other files. Whenever an important update is made to any crucial Setup file, that update is made available through Dynamic Update functionality built into the Windows Update Web site. Some of the updated files will be replacements (for example, an updated driver or updated Setup file) and some will be additions (for example, a driver not available at the time that the Setup CD was created). It is recommended that you use Dynamic Update when running Setup.</p>
                  <p>Dynamic Update has been carefully designed so that it is reliable and easy to use:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      The files on the Dynamic Update section of the Windows Update Web site have been carefully tested and selected. Only files that are important in ensuring that Setup runs well are made available through Dynamic Update. Files with minor updates that will not significantly affect Setup are not part of Dynamic Update. <br></br>

                      Because Dynamic Update downloads only the files that are required for your computer, the Dynamic Update software briefly examines your computer hardware. No personal information is collected, and no information is saved. The only purpose is to select appropriate drivers for your hardware configuration. This keeps the download as short as possible and ensures that only necessary drivers are downloaded to your hard disk. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      You can use Dynamic Update when running a preinstallation compatibility check from the product CD, or when running Setup itself. Either way, you obtain the most up-to-date files for running Setup. For information about running the compatibility check, see "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this topic. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      You can use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup. Preparing for this requires several steps. For a brief description of unattended Setup, see the "Planning for Unattended Setup" section in "<a href="#BKMK_5">Running Setup for a New Installation</a>" later in this topic. For details about how to use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup (also called automated installation), see Automating and Customizing Installations in the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=29883" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=29883</a><br></br>

            <b>What licensing mode to use</b>
          </p>
          <p>With products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, you can choose between two licensing modes:</p>
          <ul><li>
              
                <b>Per Device or Per User </b>
              <br></br>
            </li><li>
              
                <b>Per Server</b>
              <br></br>
            </li></ul>
          <p>
            <b>Per Device or Per User</b> mode requires a separate Client Access License (CAL) for each device or user that accesses a server running a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. <b>Per Server</b> mode requires a separate CAL for each concurrent connection to a server. For more information about licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this topic.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Whether you want to be able to choose between different operating systems each time you start the computer</b>
          </p>
          <p>You can set up a computer so that each time you restart it, you can choose from several different operating systems. For more information, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating System" later in this topic.</p>
          <p>
            <b>What file system to use on the installation partition</b>
          </p>
          <p>You can potentially choose among three file systems for an installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly recommended in most situations. It is the only file system that supports Active Directory&#174;, which includes many important features such as domains and domain-based security. However, it might be necessary to have a FAT or FAT32 partition on a basic disk in an x86-based computer, if you must set up the computer so that it sometimes runs Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, and sometimes runs Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 or an earlier operating system. For more information, see "Choosing a File System for the Installation Partition" later in this topic.</p>
          <p>
            <b>What partition or volume you plan to install the operating system on</b>
          </p>
          <p>If you are performing a new installation, review your disk partitions or volumes before you run Setup (for an upgrade, you will use existing partitions or volumes). Both partitions and volumes divide a disk into one or more areas that can be formatted for use by one file system. Different partitions and volumes often have different drive letters (for example, C: and D:). After you run Setup, you can make adjustments to the disk configuration, as long as you do not reformat or change the partition or volume that contains the operating system. For information about planning the partitions or volumes for a new installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New Installations" later in this topic.</p>
          <p>
            <b>How to handle IP addresses and TCP/IP name resolution</b>
          </p>
          <p>With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you need to make decisions about how to handle IP addressing and name resolution (the translating of IP addresses into names that users recognize). For more information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" later in this topic.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Whether to create domains or workgroups for your servers</b>
          </p>
          <p>A <i>domain</i> is a group of accounts and network resources&#160;that share a common directory database and set of security policies, and might have security relationships with other domains. A&#160;<i>workgroup</i> is a more basic grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains" later in this topic.</p>

          <p>Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family support two licensing modes:</p>
          <ul><li>
              
                <b>Per Device or Per User </b>
              <br></br>
            </li><li>
              
                <b>Per Server</b>
              <br></br>
            </li></ul>
          <p>If you choose the <b>Per Device or Per User</b> mode, each device or user that accesses a server running a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family requires a separate Client Access License (CAL). With one CAL, a particular device or user can connect to any number of servers running products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. This is the most commonly used licensing method for companies with more than one server running products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family.</p>
          <p>In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words, this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time. For example, if you select the Per Server client-licensing mode with five licenses, this server could have five concurrent connections at any one time (if each client requires one connection, this is five clients at any one time). The clients using the connections do not need any additional licenses.</p>
          <p>The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies with only one server. It is also useful for Internet or remote access servers where the client computers might not be licensed as network clients for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. You can specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject any additional logon requests.</p>
          <p>If you are unsure which mode to use, choose <b>Per Server</b>, because you can change once from Per Server mode to Per Device or Per User mode at no cost. After you choose Per Server and complete Setup, you can display topics about licensing modes in Help and Support Center (click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>). If you use Terminal Server, be sure to look for topics about Terminal Server Licensing.</p>

To use Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, during the partitioning phase, find the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and then delete it (which erases all data on all volumes). You will be prompted to confirm your action. After you do this, the disk will contain only unpartitioned space, and you can use Setup to create a new (basic disk) partition on it.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Reasons to Install Only One Operating System</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Setting up a computer so that you can choose between two or more operating systems at startup does have an advantage: it allows you to use applications that run only with a particular operating system. However, there are definite reasons to install only one operating system:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  Each operating system uses valuable disk space. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Compatibility issues, especially file system compatibility, can be complex. For more information, see "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  On a dynamic disk (a storage type available with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family), you can have only one operating system per disk. Dynamic disks also will not work with some operating systems. For more information, see the table in the previous section, "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating System." <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  It is no longer necessary to maintain multiple operating systems as a safeguard against problems with starting the computer. With products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, you have other options for system recovery. For example, if you have a problem with a newly installed device driver, you can use Safe Mode, in which Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, restarts with default settings and the minimum number of drivers. <br></br>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>On computers that contain multiple operating systems, compatibility becomes more complex when you consider file system choices. The file systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. (For more information, see "Choosing a File System for the Installation Partition" later in this topic.)</p>
              <p>NTFS is normally the recommended file system because it is more efficient and reliable, and supports important features including Active Directory and domain-based security. With NTFS, however, you need to take file system compatibility into account when considering whether to set up a computer to contain more than one operating system, because with Windows&#160;2000 and the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, NTFS has new features in addition to those in Windows&#160;NT. Files that use any new features will be completely usable or readable only when the computer is started with Windows&#160;2000 or a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. For example, a file that uses the new encryption feature will not be readable when the computer is started with Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0 or Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0, Enterprise Edition, which were released before the encryption feature existed. (For more information about features that affect file accessibility with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, see "NTFS" later in this topic.)</p>

                <p>If you want to set up a computer with both Windows&#160;NT and Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, and you want to have an NTFS partition, the only appropriate version of Windows&#160;NT is version 4.0 with the latest released Service Pack. Using the latest Service Pack maximizes compatibility between Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 and Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. (Specifically, you must have Service Pack&#160;5 or later.) Even the latest Service Pack, however, does not provide access to files using the new features in NTFS.</p>

              <p>Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, and Windows&#160;NT is not recommended. On these computers, a FAT partition containing the Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 operating system ensures that when started with Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0, the computer will have access to needed files. In addition, if Windows&#160;NT is not installed on the system partition, which is almost always the first partition on the disk, it is recommended that the system partition also be formatted with FAT. </p>
              <p>If you set up a computer so that it starts with Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51 or earlier on a FAT partition, and Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on an NTFS partition, when that computer starts with Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51, the NTFS partition will not be visible. If you set up a computer this way, and the partition containing Windows&#160;NT&#160;3.51 is not the system partition (which is almost always the first partition on the disk), the system partition must also be formatted with FAT.</p>

              <p>If you plan to set up a computer so that it contains Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 and Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, first review the following precautions:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  It is no longer necessary to maintain multiple operating systems as a safeguard against problems with starting the computer. With products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, you have other options for system recovery. For example, if you have a problem with a newly installed device driver, you can use Safe Mode, in which Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, restarts with default settings and the minimum number of drivers. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, and Windows&#160;NT is not recommended. Follow the guidelines in "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Make sure that Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 has been updated with the latest released Service Pack. For details, see "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this topic. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Install each operating system on a different partition, and install the applications used with an operating system on the same partition with it. If an application is used with two different operating systems, install it on two partitions. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Do not install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on a compressed drive unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, must be installed last. Otherwise important files that are needed for starting Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, could be overwritten. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the computer participates in a domain, use a different computer name for each installation.<br></br>

          <h4 class="subHeading">NTFS</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>This section provides background information about the features available with NTFS. Some of these features include:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  Better scalability to large drives. The maximum partition or volume size for NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as volume or partition sizes increase, performance with NTFS does not degrade as it does with FAT. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Active Directory (and domains, which are part of Active Directory). With Active Directory, you can view and control network resources easily. With domains, you can fine-tune security options while keeping administration simple. Domain controllers and Active Directory require NTFS. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Compression features, including the ability to compress or uncompress a drive, a folder, or a specific file. (However, a file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.) <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  File encryption, which greatly enhances security. (However, a file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.) <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just folders. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by making removable media such as tapes more accessible. (This feature is not included with Windows Server&#160;2003, Web Edition, or with Windows Server&#160;2003, Standard Edition.) <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Recovery logging of disk activities, which allows NTFS to restore information quickly in the event of power failure or other system problems. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is, NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that are written to. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount of disk space used by individual users.<br></br>

          <p>You must plan your disk partitions before you run Setup only if both of the following conditions are true:</p>
          <ul><li>
              You are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              The disk on which you are installing is a basic disk, not a dynamic disk. Basic disks are the disk type that existed before Windows&#160;2000; most disks are basic disks. Dynamic disks are disks that once were basic but were changed to dynamic using Windows&#160;2000, Windows&#160;XP, or a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. If you plan to install to a dynamic disk, you cannot change the volume or partition sizes on the disk during Setup, and therefore no planning is needed regarding partition sizes. Instead, review the guidelines in "Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this topic.<br></br>
            </li></ul>
          <p>Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions on a basic disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can be formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C: and D:). A basic disk can have up to four primary partitions, or three primary partitions and one extended partition. (An extended partition can be subdivided into logical drives, while a primary partition cannot be subdivided.)</p>
          <table class="alertTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="txtCell">Important </td></tr><tr><td class="alertCell">
            <p>If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard disk, be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand, because these actions will destroy any existing data. As with any major change to disk contents, it is recommended that you back up the entire contents of the hard disk before working with partitions, even if you plan to leave one or more of your partitions alone.</p>
          </td></tr></table>
          <p>Do not install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on a compressed drive unless the partition was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature. (Uncompress a DriveSpace or DoubleSpace drive before running Setup on it.)</p>
          <p>Before you run Setup to perform a new installation, determine the size of the partition on which to install. There is no set formula for figuring a partition size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of room for the operating system, applications, and other files that you plan to put on the installation partition. The files for setting up Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, require approximately 2&#160;GB to 3&#160;GB on an x86-based computer and 4&#160;GB on an Itanium or x64-based computer, as described in "System Requirements" earlier in this topic. It is recommended that you allow considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. It is not unreasonable to allow 4&#160;GB to 10&#160;GB on the partition, or more for large installations. This allows space for a variety of items, including optional components, user accounts, Active Directory information, logs, future service packs, the paging file used by the operating system, and other items.</p>
          <p>When you perform a new installation, you can specify the partition on which to install. If you specify a partition on which another operating system exists, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.</p>
          <p>During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. After installation is complete, you can use Disk Management to manage new and existing disks and volumes. This includes creating new partitions from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming, and reformatting existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks; and changing a basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic to basic. (If you want to have a dynamic disk on a computer that contains more than one operating system, be sure to read "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this topic.)</p>
          <p>On Itanium-based computers with more than one disk, you can plan not only the sizes of partitions, but also the <i>partition style</i> for each disk. A partition style determines the way that information about the partition is stored. There are two partition styles. The newer style (used on Itanium-based computers only) stores partition information in the globally unique identifier (GUID) partition table (GPT). The older style stores information in the master boot record (MBR). On Itanium-based computers, you must install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on a GPT disk. With GPT, you can create more partitions and larger volumes, and take advantage of other benefits. For more information about partition styles on Itanium-based computers, see the Windows Server&#160;2003 Technical Reference on the Web: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31778" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=31778</a></p>

This ensures that Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, will not overwrite crucial files that are needed by the other operating system.

              <p>If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server so that you can install operating systems onto other computers, a separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services is necessary. Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for the Single Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services.</p>
              <p>If you need to create a new partition for Remote Installation Services, plan on doing it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned disk space so that you can create it (at least 4&#160;GB of space is recommended). As an alternative, for the system disk (not cluster disks), you can plan to make the disk a dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk space than a basic disk. (However, if you want to have a dynamic disk on a computer that contains more than one operating system, see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this topic.)</p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Options When Partitioning a Disk</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.</p>
              <p>If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the following options:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the partition on which you will install a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk space, you can create the partition for your Windows Server&#160;2003 family product by using the unpartitioned space. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough, you can install a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family on that partition, with or without reformatting the partition first. Reformatting a partition erases all data on the partition. If you do not reformat the partition, but you do install a Windows Server&#160;2003 family product where there is already an operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and you must reinstall any applications you want to use with the Windows Server&#160;2003 family product. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to create more unpartitioned disk space for a partition for a Windows Server&#160;2003 family product. Deleting an existing partition also erases any data on that partition.<br></br>

              <ul><li>
                  If you used Windows&#160;2000 or Windows&#160;XP to change a disk with no partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk to basic before you can install an operating system on&#160;it. <br></br>

              <p>You can use Windows&#160;2000 or Windows&#160;XP to revert the disk, or you can use the Setup program for a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. To use Windows&#160;2000 or Windows&#160;XP, follow the instructions in Help for your operating system. To use Setup for a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, during the partitioning phase, find the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and then delete it (which erases all data on all volumes).

By using the dynamic disk technology introduced with Windows&#160;2000, you can use similar technologies, with the added flexibility of being able to extend disk volumes without repartitioning or reformatting.</p>
              <p>This transition from the technologies used in Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 means that you must make certain choices before running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition.

Ensure that you have applied Service Pack&#160;5 or later, which is required before running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. Then run Setup.</p>
              <p>
                <b>For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up the data and delete the set</b>

Next, delete the set (which will delete the data). Ensure that you have applied Service Pack&#160;5 or later, required before running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. Then run Setup.</p>
              <p>After running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up data as necessary, and make use of the volume options shown in the table later in this section.

          <p>TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or different network adapters and their associated protocols on your servers. Setup and Manage Your Server (which includes the Configure Your Server Wizard) are designed to make it easy to configure TCP/IP and the services that support it.</p>
          <p>To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this type of name to an IP address is called name resolution, and can be accomplished by various methods, primarily the Domain Name System (DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections provide more information.</p>
          <p>For detailed information about TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, and WINS, see Help and Support Center as well as the <i>Windows Server&#160;2003 Technical Reference</i>. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">IP Addresses</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>As outlined in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an IP address be provided for each computer. This section describes IP addressing options. For descriptions of name resolution options, which are also needed in a TCP/IP network, see "Name Resolution for TCP/IP" later in this topic.</p>
              <p>There are two basic approaches for providing an IP address for a server you are installing:</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</h5>
                  <p>You can provide IP addresses to the computers on your network by configuring one or more DHCP servers, which provide IP addresses dynamically to other computers. A DHCP server must itself be assigned a static IP address.</p>
                  <p>One server or several servers can provide DHCP along with one or more name resolution services, which are called Domain Name System (DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The name resolution services are described in the next section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP."</p>
                  <p>If you want to run Setup before you have finalized your decisions about which server to use as your DHCP server and what static IP address to assign to that server, you can choose <b>Typical settings</b> in the <b>Networking Settings</b> dialog box during Setup and complete the network configuration later. If you do this and there is no DHCP server in the network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). During the time that a server is using APIPA, it can communicate only with other computers using APIPA on the same network segment. A server that is using APIPA cannot make connections to the Internet (for browsing or e-mail), and cannot be used with DNS or Active Directory (which depends on DNS).</p>
                  <p>If you know which server you want to use as your DHCP server, when installing that server, in the <b>Networking Settings</b> dialog box in Setup, choose <b>Custom settings</b>, and specify a static IP address and related network settings. For more information about how to do this, see "Specifying Networking Settings" in "<a href="#BKMK_5">Running Setup for a New Installation</a>" later in this topic. After Setup, use Manage Your Server, along with information in Help and Support Center (click <b>Start</b> and then click <b>Help and Support</b>) to install the DHCP component and complete the configuration of the DHCP server.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Static IP addressing</h5>
                  <p>For certain types of servers, you must assign a static IP address and subnet mask during or after Setup. These servers include DHCP servers, DNS servers, WINS servers, and any server providing access to users on the Internet. It is also recommended that you assign a static IP address and subnet mask for each domain controller. If a computer has more than one network adapter, you must assign a separate IP address for each adapter.</p>
                  <p>If you want to run Setup on a server before you have finalized your decision about the static IP address you want to assign to that server, you can choose <b>Typical settings</b> in the <b>Networking Settings</b> dialog box during Setup and configure that server later. In this situation, if there is a DHCP server in the network, Setup will obtain an IP address configuration from DHCP. If there is no DHCP server in the network, Setup will use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). APIPA is described in the previous item in this list, "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)."</p>
                  <p>For more information about static IP addresses, including private IP addresses (which you choose from certain ranges of addresses) and public IP addresses (which you obtain from an Internet service provider), see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>
                  <p>After you have formed a plan for IP addressing, the next components to consider are those for name resolution, which is the process of mapping a computer name (something that users can recognize and remember) to the appropriate IP address. The following sections describe options for name resolution.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Name Resolution for TCP/IP</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical IP addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP network. The name-resolution services are Domain Name System (DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">DNS</h5>
                  <p>DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is often used as a name resolution service in domains with clients running Windows&#160;2000, Windows&#160;XP, or products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family.</p>
                  <p>DNS is installed automatically when you create a domain controller (or when you install Active Directory on an existing member server, which makes it a domain controller), unless the software for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition detects that a DNS server already exists for that domain. You can also install DNS by choosing the DNS server role in Manage Your Server or by using Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.</p>
                  <p>If you plan to install DNS on a server, specify a static IP address on that server and configure that server to use that IP address for its own name resolution. For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Static IP Addressing" earlier in this topic. For more information about configuring DNS, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>).</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">WINS</h5>
                  <p>If you provide support for clients running Windows&#160;NT or any earlier Microsoft operating system, you might need to install Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. You might also need to install WINS if it is required by your applications. You can install WINS after Setup by choosing the WINS server role in Manage Your Server or by using Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.</p>
                  <p>If you plan to install WINS on a server, specify a static IP address on that server. For information about assigning a static IP address, see "Static IP Addressing" earlier in this topic. For more information about configuring WINS, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>).</p>

      <a name="DecidingBetweenWorkgroupsandDomains"></a><A name="EFBBHBHA"></A><h3 class="subHeading">Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains</h3><div class="subSection">
          <p>A <i>domain</i> is a group of accounts and network resources that share a common directory database and set of security policies, and might have security relationships with other domains. A <i>workgroup</i> is a more basic grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.</p>
          <p>In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and permissions are simpler to keep track of, because a domain has a single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other network details. The information in this database is replicated automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.</p>
          <p>Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more information about Active Directory, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>).</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>With Windows Server&#160;2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition; or Windows Server&#160;2003, Datacenter Edition, servers in a domain can have one of two roles: <i>domain controllers</i>, which contain matching copies of the user accounts and other Active Directory data in a given domain, and <i>member servers</i>, which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain, is called a <i>stand-alone server</i>.) It is possible to change the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to member server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete. However, it is recommended that you plan your domain before running Setup and change server roles (and server names) only when necessary.</p>
              <p>Multiple domain controllers provide better support for users, compared to a single domain controller. With multiple domain controllers, you have multiple copies of user account data and other Active Directory data; however, it is still important to perform regular backups, including Automated System Recovery backups, and familiarize yourself with the methods for restoring a domain controller. In addition, multiple domain controllers work together to support domain controller functions, such as carrying out logon validations. For more information about domain controllers and other Active Directory topics, see Help and Support Center (after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>).</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Special Aspects of Windows Server&#160;2003 Family Domain Controllers</h5>
                  <p>As you manage your Windows Server&#160;2003 family domains, you might want to learn more about operations master roles. This section describes operations master roles briefly. You can find more information in Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>
                  <p>Operations master roles are special roles that are assigned to one or more domain controllers in an Active Directory domain. The domain controllers that are assigned these roles perform operations that are single-master (not permitted to occur at different places in a network at the same time). For example, a single domain controller must oversee the creation of security identifiers for new resources (such as new computers) to ensure that the identifiers are unique.</p>
                  <p>The first domain controller installed in a domain is automatically assigned all the operations master roles. You can change the assignment of operations master roles after Setup, but in most cases this is not necessary. You will need to be particularly aware of operations masters roles if problems develop on an operations master or if you plan to take one out of service. For more information about operations master roles, which are part of Active Directory, see Help and Support Center.</p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Checking the System Log for Errors</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If the computer already has a working operating system, review the system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors) that could cause problems during the installation. For information about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on your computer.</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Backing Up Files</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Before you perform a new installation, it is recommended that you back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or the current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or the hard disk of another computer on the network.</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Uncompressing the Drive</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Uncompress any DriveSpace or DoubleSpace volumes before installing. Do not install Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on a compressed drive unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS file system compression feature.</p>
            </div>
          <h4 class="subHeading">Preparing Mirror Sets and Other Disk Sets (Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 only)</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>With the disk management technologies in Windows&#160;NT&#174;&#160;4.0, you could create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using dynamic disks, introduced with Windows&#160;2000, you can take advantage of similar technologies, and with Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, you can also extend dynamic volumes without repartitioning or reformatting.</p>
              <p>This transition from the technologies used in Windows&#160;NT&#160;4.0 means that you must make certain choices before running Setup for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. For important information about these choices, see the "Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" section in "<a href="#BKMK_4">Getting Ready for a New Installation</a>" earlier in this topic.</p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, provide the appropriate driver file or HAL file during Setup.</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process</h5>
                  <p>If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is designed for products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family by checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37823" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37823</a></p>
                  <p>If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can gain access to the mass storage controller.</p>
                  <p>If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file, restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.</p>

                  <p>If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6: at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts to include your HAL file in the Setup process.</p>

          <p>This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation on an Itanium-based computer. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x86-based computer, see "Starting Setup on an x86-based Computer" earlier in this topic. For an explanation of how to start Setup on an x64-based computer, see the next section.</p>
          <p>In computers with the Itanium processor or the Itanium 2 processor, the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is the interface between a computer's firmware, hardware, and operating system. The EFI defines a new partition style called GUID partition table (GPT). The installation partition on an Itanium-based computer must be on a GPT disk. Setup automatically specifies GPT for the disk used for installation. You can still read and write to master boot record (MBR) volumes, which are common to most PCs, but you cannot install on one.</p>
          <p>You cannot access GPT disks locally from an x86-based computer. If you want to move a disk from an Itanium-based computer to an x86-based computer, use an MBR disk. This is true regardless of whether the disk is basic or dynamic.</p>
          <p>Before installing, verify that you are using the correct version of the firmware. For more information, refer to the hardware manufacturer's documentation.</p>
          <table class="alertTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="txtCell">Important </td></tr><tr><td class="alertCell">
            <p>Itanium-based computers require a minimum 100-MB FAT partition for the operation of the EFI. This EFI system partition is created automatically during Setup, and it stores programs and information files that the EFI uses to start the operating system. Do not delete or reformat this partition.</p>
          </td></tr></table>
          <p>Setup also creates a Microsoft Reserved Partition (MSR), which is required by the operating system. The size of this partition depends on the size of the hard disk. On drives less than 16 GB in size, the MSR is 32 MB. On drives greater than or equal to 16 GB, the MSR is 128 MB. Do not delete or reformat this partition.</p>

                  <p>If a computer is part of a domain, you must choose a computer name that is different from any other computer in the domain. To avoid name conflicts, the computer should be unique on the domain, workgroup, or network. If this computer is part of a domain, and it contains more than one operating system, you must use a unique computer name for each operating system that is installed. For example, if the computer name is FileServerNT when the computer is started with Windows&#160;NT&#160;Server&#160;4.0, the computer must have a different name, perhaps FileServerNew, when it is started with a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family.

      <a name="ProductActivationforProductsintheWindowsServer2003Family3"></a><A name="EFBBFBHA"></A><h3 class="subHeading">Product Activation for Products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 Family</h3><div class="subSection">
          <p>After you install a product in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family, if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This results in better products and more innovation for customers.</p>
          <p>The following details help explain product activation:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Software reminders</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function, except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop for Administration (the new name for the Windows&#160;2000 functionality known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard..</p>
          <p>
            <b>How the software handles activation</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product, it means that your product key is now associated with the computer (the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)).</p>
          <p>Your local operating system does some of the work of creating the association between your product key and the computer it is installed on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key, and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer (without representing any personal information or anything about the software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person’s activation will not work.</p>
          <p>The Installation ID that the local operating system generates, representing the association between your product key and the computer it is install on, is used only for the purpose of activation.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Methods for activation</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;After your operating system is installed, begin activation by clicking Start, and then clicking Activate Windows. (You can also click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the screen.) By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate through the Internet or by phone:</p>
          <ul><li>
              
                <b>Internet:</b> When you activate through the Internet, your computer transmits coded information that shows that your product key is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is passed back to your computer, automatically activating your product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to complete. No personally identifiable information is required to activate your product. <br></br>
            </li><li>
              
                <b>Phone:</b> When you activate by phone, information on the screen guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the country or region where you are located, a phone number (toll-free, wherever possible) appears on your screen. When you call the number, a customer service representative asks for the Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The customer service representative enters that number into a secure database, confirms that the number represents a legally installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then, you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the screen, and activation is complete.<br></br>
            </li></ul>
          <p>
            <b>Reactivation (rarely needed)</b>&#160;&#160;&#160;If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick, simple process, you can reactivate your product.</p>
        
          <h4 class="subHeading">Product Activation Compared to Product Registration</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>Product activation is not the same as product registration. As discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional, and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive information about product updates and special offers directly from Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely, and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.</p>

      <p>With Microsoft&#174; Windows&#160;Server&#8482;&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, and Microsoft Windows Server&#160;2003, Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering to ensure that users have constant access to important server-based resources. With clustering, you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as one server. If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node begins to provide service (a process known as failover). Critical applications and resources remain continuously available.</p>

                <p>If you are using a shared storage device, before creating a cluster, when you turn on the computer and start the operating system, it very important that only one node has access to the cluster disk. Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted. To prevent the corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but one cluster node, or use other techniques (for example, LUN masking, selective presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster disks, before creating the cluster. Once the Cluster service is running properly on one node, the other nodes can be installed and configured simultaneously. Each node of your cluster must be running Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition.</p>
              </td></tr></table>
              <p>In your planning, review the following items:</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Cluster hardware and drivers</h5>
                  <p>Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are compatible with the Windows Server&#160;2003 family. Confirm that your entire cluster solution is compatible with products in the Windows Server&#160;2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37824" target="_blank" alt="" target="_blank">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=37824</a></p>
                  <p>For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as spanned volumes (volume sets).</p>
                  <p>Review the manufacturer’s instructions carefully before you begin installing cluster hardware. Otherwise the cluster storage could be corrupted. If your cluster hardware includes a SCSI bus, be sure to carefully review any instructions about termination of the SCSI bus and configuration of SCSI IDs.</p>
                  <p>To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Network adapters on the cluster nodes</h5>
                  <p>In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network adapter will carry. The following list provides details about the types of communication that an adapter can carry:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      Only node-to-node communication (private network). This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to carry other communication. <br></br>
                      For node-to-node communication, you connect the network adapter to a private network that is used exclusively within the cluster. Note that if the private network uses a single hub or network switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential point of failure in your cluster.<br></br>
                      The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet but you can use virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective of the Windows operating system running on the nodes. To avoid single points of failure, use independent VLAN hardware for the different paths between the nodes.<br></br>
                      If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, it is a best practice for the adapters for those networks to use static IP addresses instead of DHCP.<br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Only client-to-cluster communication (public network). This implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to carry other communication. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed network). When you have multiple network adapters per node, a network adapter that carries both kinds of communication can serve as a backup for other network adapters. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Communication unrelated to the cluster. If a clustered node also provides services unrelated to the cluster, and there are enough adapters in the cluster node, you might want to use one adapter for carrying communication unrelated to the cluster.<br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                  <p>The nodes of a cluster must be connected by two or more local area networks (LANs); at least two networks are required to prevent a single point of failure. A server cluster whose nodes are connected by only one network is not a supported configuration. The adapters, cables, hubs, and switches for each network must fail independently. This usually implies that the components of any two networks must be physically independent.</p>
                  <p>At least two networks must be configured to handle <b>All communications (mixed network)</b> or <b>Internal cluster communications only (private network)</b>.</p>
                  <p>The recommended configuration for two adapters is to use one adapter for the private (node-to-node only) communication and the other adapter for mixed communication (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster communication). Do not use teaming network adapters on the private network.</p>
                  <p>If you use fault tolerant network adapters, create multiple private networks instead of a single fault-tolerant network.</p>
                  <p>Do not configure a default gateway or DNS or WINS server on the private network adapters. Do not configure private network adapters to use name resolution servers on the public network; otherwise a name resolution server on the public network might map a name to an IP address on the private network. If a client then received that IP address from the name resolution server, it might fail to reach the address because no route from the client to the private network address exists.</p>
                  <p>Configure WINS and/or DNS servers on the public network adapters. If Network Name resources are used on the public networks, set up the DNS servers to support dynamic updates; otherwise the Network Name resources may not fail over correctly. Also, configure a default gateway on the public network adapters. If there are multiple public networks in the cluster, configure a default gateway on only one of these.</p>
                  <p>When you use either the New Server Cluster Wizard or the Add Nodes Wizard to install clustering on a node that contains two network adapters, by default the wizard configures both of the network adapters for mixed network communications. As a best practice, reconfigure one adapter for private network communications only. For more information, see "Change how the cluster uses a network" in Help and Support Center for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Help and Support</b>.</p>
                  <p>Consider choosing a name for each connection that tells what it is intended for. The name will make it easier to identify the connection whenever you are configuring the server.</p>
                  <p>Manually configure the communication settings, such as Speed, Duplex Mode, Flow Control and Media Type of each cluster network adapter. Do not use automatic detection. You must configure all of the cluster network adapters to use the same communication settings.</p>
                  <p>The adapters on a given node must connect to networks in different subnets.</p>
                  <p>Do not use the same IP address for two network adapters, even if they are connected to two different networks.</p>

                    <li>If you use a crossover cable to implement a private network, when the cluster is created on the first node the second node should be turned on but stopped in the BIOS or at the startup menu. In this state, the Media Sense feature of Windows might not recognize the network adapter as connected. If you continue creating the cluster, the crossover cable will be detected when you start the second node. The network will be established in the default mode, which is mixed. You can then change the network mode to private using Cluster Administrator.</li>

              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Cluster IP address</h5>
                  <p>Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use DHCP for this address.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">IP addressing for cluster nodes</h5>
                  <p>Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the individual cluster nodes. Each network adapter on each node requires IP addressing. It is a best practice to assign each network adapter a static IP address. As an alternative, you can provide IP addressing through DHCP. If you use static IP addresses, set the addresses for each linked pair of network adapters (linked node-to-node) to be on the same subnet.</p>
                  <p>Note that if you use DHCP for the individual cluster nodes, it can act as a single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster nodes so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses, temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary unavailability of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use DHCP, evaluate ways to ensure availability of DHCP services, and consider the possibility of using long leases for the cluster nodes. This helps to ensure that they always have a valid IP address.</p>

The cluster name must be different from the domain name, from all computer names on the domain, and from other cluster names on the domain.</p>

                  <p>To install and configure the cluster service, you must be using an account that is in the local Administrators group on each node. As you install and configure each node, if you are not using an account in the local Administrators group, you will be prompted to provide the logon credentials for such an account.</p>
                </div>
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Cluster service user account</h5>
                  <p>Create or obtain the Cluster service user account. This is the name and password under which the Cluster service will run. You need to supply this user name and password during cluster installation.</p>
                  <p>It is best if the Cluster service user account is an account not used for any other purpose. If you have multiple clusters, set up a unique Cluster service user account for each cluster. The account must be a domain account; it cannot be a local account. However, do not make this account a domain administrator account because it does not need domain administrator user rights.</p>
                  <p>As part of the cluster setup process, the Cluster service user account is added to the local Administrators group on each node. As well as being a member of the local Administrators group, the Cluster service user account requires an additional set of user rights:</p>
                  <ul><li>
                      Act as part of the operating system. <br></br>
                    </li><li>
                      Back up files and directories. <br></br>

                      Restore files and directories.<br></br>
                    </li></ul>
                  <p>These user rights are also granted to the Cluster service user account as part of the cluster setup process. Be aware that the Cluster service user account will continue to have these user rights even after all nodes are evicted from the cluster. The risk that this presents is mitigated by the fact that these user rights are not granted domain wide, but rather only locally on each former node. However, remove this account from each evicted node if it is no longer needed.</p>
                  <p>Be sure to keep the password from expiring on the Cluster service user account (follow your organization’s policies for password renewal).</p>

                  <p>Plan on setting aside a volume on your cluster storage for holding important cluster configuration information. This information makes up the cluster quorum resource, which is needed when a cluster node stops functioning. The quorum resource provides node-independent storage of crucial data needed by the cluster. For important information about quorum resource options, see "Quorum Resource Options" later in this topic.</p>
                  <p>The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. It is recommended that you do not store user data on any volume in the quorum resource.</p>

Partition and format all disks on the cluster storage device before adding the first node to your cluster. Do not configure them as dynamic disks, and do not use spanned volumes (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks. For 64-bit editions of Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, cluster disks on the cluster storage device must be partitioned as MBR and not as GPT disks. </p>

          <h4 class="subHeading">Quorum Resource Options</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>With server clusters on Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, you can now choose between three&#160;ways to set up the quorum resource (the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster configuration data and that&#160;must always be available for the cluster to run). The first is a single node server cluster, which has been available in the past and continues to be supported. A single node cluster is often used for development and testing and can be configured with, or without, external cluster storage devices. For single node clusters without an external cluster storage device, the local disk is configured as the cluster quorum device.</p>
              <p>The second option is a single quorum device server cluster, which has also been available in earlier Windows versions. This model places the cluster configuration data on a shared cluster storage device that all nodes can access.</p>
              <p>This is the most common model and is recommended for most situations. You might choose the single quorum device model if all of your cluster nodes are in the same location and you want to take advantage of the fact&#160;such a cluster continues supporting&#160;users even&#160;if only one node is running.</p>
              <p>The third option, which is new for Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, is a "majority node set." A majority node set is a single quorum resource from a server-cluster perspective; however, the cluster configuration data is actually stored on multiple disks across the cluster. The majority node set resource ensures that the cluster configuration data is kept consistent across the different disks. </p>
              <p>In the majority node set model, every node in the cluster uses a directory on its own local system disk to store the cluster configuration data. If the configuration of the cluster changes, that change is reflected across the different disks. Be aware that it is also possible to have shared storage devices in a majority node set cluster. The exact configuration depends on the requirements for your installation.</p>
              <p>Only use a majority node set cluster in targeted scenarios, such as:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  Geographically dispersed cluster: A cluster that spans multiple sites. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Eliminating single points of failure: Although when using a single cluster storage device the quorum disk itself can be made highly available via RAID, the controller port or the Host Bus Adapters (HBA) itself may be a single point of failure. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Clusters with no shared disks: There are some specialized configurations that need tightly consistent cluster features without having shared disks. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Clusters that host applications that can fail over, but where there is some other, application-specific way, to replicate or mirror data between nodes: For example, this model is useful if you use database log shipping for keeping a SQL database state up to date.<br></br>
                </li></ul>
              <p>Do not configure your cluster as a majority node set cluster unless it is part of a cluster solution offered by your Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Independent Software Vendor (ISV), or Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV).</p>
            
              <div class="subSection"><h5 class="subHeading">Cluster Model Considerations</h5>
                  <p>Before implementing your cluster, consider what type of quorum resource solution you plan to use. Take into consideration the following differences between single quorum device clusters and majority node set:</p>

                  <p>You would commonly use a single quorum resource model if all nodes in your cluster will be in the same geographical location. As part of this requirement, your nodes must be connected to the same physical storage device.</p>
                  <p>A majority node set on the other hand would typically be appropriate if you have geographically dispersed nodes. The cluster configuration data is stored locally on each node on a file share that is shared out to the other nodes on the network. However, those shares must always be accessible or nodes can fail.</p>
                  <p>There are other specific requirements for geographically dispersed clusters, including the requirement that round-trip latency of the network between cluster nodes be a maximum of 500 milliseconds.

              <p>If you are using a SCSI shared storage device, when you first attach your cluster hardware (the shared bus and cluster storage), be sure to work only from the firmware configuration screens on the cluster nodes (a node is a server in a cluster). On x86-based and x64-based computers, use the BIOS configuration screens. On Itanium-based computers, use the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) configuration screens. The instructions from your manufacturer will describe whether these configuration screens are displayed automatically or whether you must, after turning on the computer, press specific keys to access them. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI configuration process. Remain in the BIOS or EFI configuration screens, and do not allow the operating system to start, during this initial installation phase. Complete the following steps while the cluster nodes are still displaying BIOS or EFI configuration screens, before starting the operating system on the first cluster node.</p>

              <ul><li>
                  Make sure you understand and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for termination of the SCSI bus. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Make sure that each device on the shared bus (both SCSI controllers and hard disks) has a unique SCSI ID. If the SCSI controllers all have the same default ID (often it is SCSI ID 7), change one controller to a different SCSI ID, such as SCSI ID 6. If there is more than one disk that will be on the shared SCSI bus, each disk must also have a unique SCSI ID. In addition, make sure that the bus is not configured to reset SCSI IDs automatically on startup (otherwise the IDs will change from the settings you specify). <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  Ensure that you can scan the bus and see the drives from all cluster nodes (while remaining in the BIOS or EFI configuration screens).<br></br>

                  During this initial installation phase, remain in the BIOS or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) configuration process, and do not allow the operating system to start. While viewing the BIOS or EFI configuration screens, ensure that you can scan the bus and see the drives from the active cluster node. On x86-based and x64-based computers, use the BIOS configuration screens. On Itanium-based computers, use the EFI configuration screens. Consult the instructions from your manufacturer to determine whether these configuration screens are displayed automatically or whether you must, after turning on the computer, press specific keys to access them.

          <h4 class="subHeading">Final Steps to Complete the Installation</h4><div class="subSection">
              <p>If you have not already installed Windows Server&#160;2003, Enterprise Edition, on the first cluster node, install it before proceeding. For information about decisions you must make, such as decisions about licensing and about the components to install, see "<a href="#BKMK_4">Getting Ready for a New Installation</a>" earlier in this topic. For information about running Setup, see "<a href="#BKMK_5">Running Setup for a New Installation</a>" earlier in this topic.</p>
              <p>After you complete the BIOS or EFI configuration, start the operating system on one cluster node only, and complete the configuration of the Cluster service using Cluster Administrator.</p>
              <p>With the Cluster Administrator New Server Cluster Wizard, you can choose between Typical (full) configuration and Advanced (minimum) configuration options. Typical configuration is appropriate for most installations and results in a completely configured cluster. Use the Advanced configuration option only for clusters that have complex storage configurations that the New Server Cluster Wizard cannot validate or for configurations in which you do not want the cluster to manage all of the storage. The following examples describe each situation:</p>
              <ul><li>
                  In some complex storage solutions, such as a fiber channel switched fabric that contains several switches, a particular storage unit might have a different identity on each computer in the cluster. Although this is a valid storage configuration, it violates the storage validation heuristics in the New Server Cluster Wizard. If you have this type of storage solution, you might receive an error when you are trying to create a cluster using the Typical configuration option. If your storage configuration is set up correctly, you can disable the storage validation heuristics and avoid this error by restarting the New Server Cluster Wizard, selecting the Advanced configuration option instead. <br></br>
                </li><li>
                  On particular nodes in a cluster, you may want to have some disks that are to be clustered and some disks that are to be kept private. The Typical configuration option configures all disks as clustered disks and creates cluster resources for them all. However, with the Advanced configuration option, you can keep certain disks private because this configuration creates a cluster in which only the quorum disk is managed by the cluster (if you chose to use a physical disk as the quorum resource). After the cluster is created, you must then use Cluster Administrator to add any other disks that you want the cluster to manage.<br></br>
                </li></ul>
              <p>If you are using a shared storage device: Before creating a cluster, when you turn the computer on and start the operating system, it is very important that only one node has access to the cluster disk. Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted. To prevent the corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but one cluster node, or use other techniques (for example, LUN masking, selective presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster disks before creating the cluster. Also, before starting the installation of the second and subsequent nodes, ensure that all disks that are to be managed by the cluster have disk resources associated with them. If these disks do not have disk resources associated with them at this time, the disk data will be corrupted because the disks will not be protected and multiple nodes will attempt to connect to them at the same time.</p>
